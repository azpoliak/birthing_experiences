Graduated at 42+1. Positive medicated hospital birth story.,"[('0.3', 'My boyfriend was absolutely incredible. I love him so so much. My doctor wasn’t available at the time so a different doctor that I had met the Friday before filled in. She isn’t my favorite, but at the time I really didn’t care.'), ('0.4', 'As she got closer her heart rate and my blood pressure dropped and I started running a fever of 101 so they said we needed to use a suction (vacuum or whatever they called it) to help her out. The towel over the eyes helped with that, too. She was out 2 sets of 3 pushes later and it was such a strange and relieving sensation. The epidural numbness was perfect in my opinion in that I could feel enough pressure to keep up with what was going on down there, but no sharpness or intense pain at all.'), ('0.5', 'She had swallowed some meconium and amniotic fluid so they took her to her station immediately (after clamping and cutting umbilical cord) to clear her lungs. The first strong cry I heard was the most amazing moment of my life. They set her on my chest to hold for a few minutes before they had to take her upstairs to the nursery to observe to make sure her lungs were all good. Barely even noticed delivering the placenta.'), ('0.6', 'I had a two degree tear (episiotomy) and have one helluva hemorrhoid. But the staff at my hospital couldn’t have been more amazing. And she’s just the cutest living thing I’ve ever seen in the history of ever. We get to go home tomorrow afternoon as long as her bloodwork continues to be healthy.'), ('0.7', 'She’s already a great little breast feeder and quite aware. Being 15 days late has its perks I suppose! You ladies are all amazing and I wish you all the love and luck on your journey! Be patient with yourself ❤️'), ('0.8', ''), ('0.9', '')]"
Birth story from a different perspective: Unmedicated hospital birth at 38+5 in Brazil. Very positive!,"[('0.3', ""We finally decided to get admitted and start the induction. Little did we know that the hospital was packed (this was pre-covid, in February), and there were no rooms available. I would have to labor in the infirmary (I think it's called triage in the US) until a room was available. So I called my OB one more time and asked her if I could go home. She said it was fine and off we went. The contractions weren't kidding around anymore and I started to pace around my room and bounce on the yoga ball after we got home. My boyfriend ordered some food for us and I was able to eat between contractions.""), ('0.4', ""Then, I hopped in the shower and stayed there for probably one hour while my boyfriend slept. At this point, I was already moaning like a cow and couldn't sit on the ball anymore. I was also feeling pretty exhausted from the lack of sleep, so I tried laying down a bit, but would wake up every five to seven minutes because of the contractions. At around 1 am, I started to see blood coming out and that freaked me out. We called my OB and she said it was normal and a good sign that I was progressing. I was in a lot of pain at this point, and the moaning was just getting louder. At maybe 2:30, I woke my boyfriend up and said we needed to go.""), ('0.5', ""Contractions were still at irregular intervals, but the pain was starting to get unmanageable. He called us un Uber and I moaned all my way to the hospital (which was luckily only 5 minutes from my apartment). There, the same on-call doctor checked me for the third time and said I was 9-10 centimeters dilated, but that the baby was still a bit high. I was finally admitted and went to the labor &amp; delivery unit to start preparing and wait for my doctor. The nurse prepared the shower for me and a yoga ball, but it was too painful to sit, so I just stayed in the shower until my OB got there. In the midst of trying to survive the contractions, we discovered that the pediatrician we had chosen was on call in a different town and that the on-call pediatrician didn't assist on deliveries (go figure). So my boyfriend came into the bathroom to ask me which doctor we should call.""), ('0.6', ""I just moaned at him and shook my head. I'm glad he chose the one he did because she took the most beautiful pictures. Anyway, 4 am came along, I got checked and the doctor said that the baby was still high, that it would probably be another hour until I needed to push. All I could think was that I wouldn't be able to last another hour. So I just stood there, leaning on the bed and moaning like I was dying at each contraction. Not 10 minutes later, I felt the urge to push. Got checked and the baby had dropped completely.""), ('0.7', 'I remember vividly walking to a different room that said ""labor"" on the door. I was really nervous, but also anxious to get it over with. I chose the birthing stool over the bed, even though my OB said that she could control my perineum better if she could at least see it. I felt really comfortable sitting on the stool and there was probably nothing that would make me get up from there. After three contractions and three pushes, saying I couldn\'t do it and a very loud \'fuck! \', my daughter was born. They put her on my arms and the cord was wrapped around her neck.'), ('0.8', ""They quickly untangled it with her still in my arms, cleaned her up a bit and her dad got to cut the cord. We took some pictures and she grabbed my boob when I offered. Since she was a small baby (at around 3kg), I had no tears and recovery was a breeze. Breastfeeding, on the other hand, kicked my butt, but that's a story for another day. All in all, it was a very positive experience, and I think I was able to do pretty much everything that was on my birth plan. A few country-specific clarifications: I have insurance, and that was why I could pick the OB that delivered my daughter. If I had gone to a public hospital, I would have to give birth with the on-call doctor.""), ('0.9', 'Some doctors, even if you\'re insured, will charge a ""birth fee"" to stay available for you during labor, which was not the case for my doctor, but something I would be willing to pay if that were the case. Brazil has a terrible history of obstetric violence, which is still the reality in a lot of hospitals, so I talked a lot with my doctor about my options and her practices. We also have an astronomical rate of c-sections, with doctors pushing them on pregnant women for ridiculous reasons. So, for me, having my OB with me during labor and delivery was essential.')]"
"Graduated 9/4! FTM, 40+1, epidural/hospital birth and pretty quick labor with minor complications","[('0.3', 'I got a cervical check and was at 5cm! Myself and the doctor were pretty stunned. Went over my birth plan (which was not in writing, my only plan was to have myself and baby come out alive and healthy). We then walked to our delivery room, which was lovely and private with a bathroom. I was having an internal struggle over the epidural because I have a severe needle phobia. However, the anesthesiologist at my hospital just so happens to be my sisters best friend from high school (I’ve known her close to 20 years and she was a guest at my wedding so I trust her!).'), ('0.4', 'She explained everything in detail and told me her opinion, which was that I should strongly consider it. It was probably close to noon by the time I decided to go for the epidural, as the contractions were getting unbearable. And I survived the epidural! Obviously not fun, but myself and my doctor friend regaled the nurse with some stories of our adventures from our younger years and it was a great distraction. It did take about an hour or so for it to kick in for me, but overall I’m glad I got it . About an hour and a half later, the epidural was starting to help take the edge off most contractions, but a couple strong ones were still bringing me to tears.'), ('0.5', 'I also started experiencing intense pain in my lower back. It was determined baby had flipped around, so I got on my hands and knees on the bed to encourage her to turn. This was pretty intense (I was in a lot of pain and the epidural was making it hard for me to control my legs). She eventually flipped around (maybe 10 min later) and my lower back pain subsided. Around 2pm they checked me again and I was rapidly approaching 8cm. Once I got to this point, my pain level was significantly managed with the epidural, but it did seem to slow down my dilation (I hung out at 8/9cm from around 2pm until I started pushing around 7pm).'), ('0.6', 'I honestly don’t remember much from that time period though. Just waiting to start feeling the pressure to push. They did start me on pitocin to help me along. Around 6ish (maybe?) I started to feel the pressure the nurses were describing, but it came and went with each contraction (they wanted it to sustain in between). Around 7pm, the doctor said it was time to push as they didn’t want to wait too much longer for the pressure to continue building.'), ('0.7', 'I started pushing around 7:10 and she arrived at 7:38pm! I was having some trouble feeling what I was doing while pushing bc of the epidural but otherwise, I experienced no pain at all and the nurses said I did a good job with pushing through the epidural. So baby was actually still sunny side up when she arrived and also had what they called a “left arm presentation” where she came out with her left arm raised by her head. This caused them to perform an episiotomy to make sure she didn’t get stuck. I could see the doctor stitching me up afterwards and felt the placenta being delivered and baby came out crying so they immediately placed her on my chest. This was where I thought I would feel one way and felt another way instead.'), ('0.8', 'I was so overwhelmed that I cried and thought “you were just inside my body” and managed to look at my husband (who was amazing btw, holding my leg for pushing and he did an excellent job listening to me and the nurses for how to help me). But it just felt weird having her on my chest. I didn’t feel the immediate gush of love, and in the moment it made me feel awful. They took her to clean her up and brought her right back for skin to skin with me. I don’t remember much after this as it was a blur of doctors and nurses and baby. We stayed in the hospital from Friday until Sunday, and boy was that exhausting.'), ('0.9', 'Baby never went to the nursery and I was terrified she would stop breathing. I also started breastfeeding (which was insanely painful for me up until about 2 weeks pp), which was physically and emotionally draining. I was also in decent pain from my episiotomy. Overall, the hospital stay was pretty stressful for me, but we made it through. Looking back, I’m still not sure how I feel about the entire thing. I’m also not enjoying the newborn phase and don’t feel an incredibly strong connection to my daughter yet, but I know this will come with time. I am definitely in love with her, it’s just hard for me to feel close to her when all she does is nap, eat and poop/pee. I think my painful BF experience has also affected my ability to bond with her. I don’t think I’m at PPD levels, but I’m definitely going to talk to a therapist soon about everything to help me process. Hopefully this story strikes a chord with someone, you’re not alone if you’re unsure how you feel about your labor/delivery and if you don’t bond with baby immediately!')]"
"Birth story! FTM, delivered at 41+3. Attempted unmedicated vaginal birth at birth center, transferred to hospital and got a c-section. Foley balloon induction and Hypnobabies included.","[('0.3', 'They pretty much left my husband and I alone so that I could progress. I remember starting to become really worn out around noon, and telling the midwives that I just needed to rest. They gave me a shot with some medicine that would make me sleep, and had me take the castor oil concoction to try and intensify my contractions while I slept. I woke up a couple of hours later to intense contractions that I had trouble coping with. The midwives allowed me to go ahead and get into the tub, and that’s where I spent the next 5 hours. Eventually, my contractions waned and become really irregular. I was so tired, and discouraged that I wasn’t making progress, and just started to feel like no end was in sight. I told them that I didn’t want to do this anymore. They encouraged me to keep trying, and I agreed to try out some different positions before committing to a hospital transfer. After a couple of more hours, I hadn’t changed my mind. I just wanted out, I wanted some kind of relief. I felt so happy being wheeled out of the birth center, and couldn’t wait to get to the hospital where I could have an epidural and relax.'), ('0.4', 'They sent one of the nurse midwives to come with us (as she had admitting privileges there). At the hospital, I had to be tested for COVID before the anesthesiologist would be allowed to administer an epidural. They were pretty backed up, and after a couple of hours they still didn’t have my results back. I had been vocalizing a lot, so maybe the anesthesiologist felt bad for me— he decided to administer the epidural for me anyway without waiting for the results. I didn’t even flinch as he inserted the needle for the local anesthetic. The relief was immediate. I felt myself come into the room, and looked at my husband for what seemed like the first time all day. I felt like I could breathe again, I was so happy and relaxed. I was still able to move around in the bed, which I wasn’t expecting. My legs still worked. I could still tell when I was having contractions— they just didn’t hurt anymore. But my elation didn’t translate to progress.'), ('0.5', 'After a little while, the team became concerned as they saw that my baby’s heart rate would drop with every contraction. It was later explained to me that my placenta was giving up— that after every contraction, it was taking forever to fill back up with blood, which was leading to my baby’s blood pressure dropping. This meant that pitocin wasn’t really an answer, as the last thing my body needed was more intense contractions. After monitoring me for another hour, my midwife encouraged me to consider a c-section. I didn’t hesitate, I trusted her judgment and agreed to the procedure— even though a c-section was the LAST thing I had expected after such an easy pregnancy, and so much time spent preparing for an unmedicated vaginal birth. A surgical team showed up immediately with the paperwork. They walked me through the procedure, I signed the waiver, I was in the operating room only moments later. Since my COVID test still hasn’t come back, my husband wasn’t going to be allowed to be in the room with me. Fortunately, right before they began, my results came and my husband got to be by my side the whole time. I was shaking violently because of the extra medication, but I was still able to carry on in conversation with my husband as they cut me open. It seemed like it only took a minute before I felt them pull my daughter out and we heard her cry. They pulled the sheet down for us to see her, and I couldn’t believe my eyes.'), ('0.6', 'There really HAD been a baby in there this whole time! Born 11:51pm, almost 40 hours after getting the foley balloon put in. My husband went with her as they cleaned her up and took her measurements. 7lbs 13oz, and just under 20” long. He brought her to me as they were putting me back together. I was still shaking violently, so I just put my cheek to hers. I couldn’t believe she was real. After they finished putting my guts back in, we went to a post operative room where we got to have skin to skin time. My daughter breastfed immediately, it was so easy. I was so happy that despite everything else, this part was easy and came naturally. I was so out of it. The next thing I remember was a nurse coming into our room the next morning telling me I should probably try to feed my daughter.'), ('0.7', 'I remember thinking, “Oh yeah! How could I forget. That’s something I need to do from now on.”\n\nI was totally unprepared for what having a c-section would be like. It was so difficult to even walk to the bathroom. I remember staggering to the bathroom door, naked except for my mesh underwear, smelling awful and covered in dried sweat and tears, and my husband just stood in the doorway and said “Well hello gorgeous” as he smiled. I broke down in tears. I felt so broken all over, was so exhausted from the experience, and he had been there for me through all of it. I loved him so much in that moment. I stayed in the hospital that day and another night, and then got to go home. My mom came to visit us the day we came home. I still hadn’t realized the extent of what recovery would be like, until I attempted to walk up the stairs and couldn’t take one step. I cried because I felt so broken.'), ('0.8', 'I just wanted to go outside and walk around. My husband made sure that I didn’t have to get out of bed for anything. The only thing I could do was feed our daughter. I remember feeling so upset with myself that I couldn’t carry her or change her diaper. We spent the first week in bed together, and once I accepted that it was ok to give myself time to recover, it became such a sweet experience to share with my husband and daughter. We lost of all sense of night and day, and just let our daughter drive the bus. We were so tired, but it didn’t matter, we just stayed in bed and took it easy. There was so much love between us. I let him take care of the both of us, and after a week I was able to walk around pretty easily. My daughter is 3 weeks old now, and things are still going pretty well. She’s perfectly healthy, and so laid back. Looking back now, I think I wanted to try for the “natural birth experience” just for the hell of it.'), ('0.9', 'There’s a lot out there nowadays that talks about how over-medicalized birth is in my country (USA), and I really bought into that. I read Ina May’s Guide to Childbirth, and really loved how empowering it made birth seem. Now, I still feel like all of that is valid and real for some people. It wasn’t my experience, but I’m grateful that I live in a time and place where medical interventions are so readily available because I don’t know what would have happened to my daughter or me if they hadn’t been. Maybe I was dehydrated (I only drank half a bottle of water during my whole experience, even after vomiting so much, although I did get fluids finally when I got to the hospital)... maybe I should have eaten at some point... who knows. I’m not sure why my body wasn’t able to accomplish a vaginal birth, but with every day that goes by, that matters less and less to me. It seems like my experience is a shared one based on the similar stories I’ve read here. It’s been a source of comfort to read everyone’s stories. My husband and I want to have more children, and I’m not sure if I even care about trying for a VBAC or not. I guess I have time to think about it. If I could do things over, I would have spent more time preparing mentally for different outcomes, and for what post-partum life is like. I spent so much time preparing for a birth experience that didn’t happen, and that does feel a bit like a waste. But at the end of the day, I can’t complain too much... I think we’re doing great anyway.')]"
"Graduated 10th May, here is my (very long) birth story. Planned unmedicated homebirth turned hospital induction with epidural, episiotomy and assisted delivery. Difficult but positive! (UK)","[('0.3', ""I can't even fully remember how to describe the pain but it is by far the most intense and painful thing I've experienced. Around 5pm: I was struggling to cope and I was only 4cm. I began the gas and air which helped me massively to regulate my breathing through the contractions. 6pm, 5cm dilated: The contractions were so intense and lasting around 12-13 deep breaths. I had a shot of pethadine at this stage (previously swore I would NOT want it) and it was bliss!""), ('0.4', ""I was like a happy, lovely drunk, chatting away to the midwife, telling my husband how much I love him. I could still feel the contractions but everything was goooood and I could rest a little. 4am(ish) Mon 10th, 9cm dilated but not progressing: By this point I was delirious with exhaustion, the pethadine had worn off and I couldn't keep my eyes open between contractions. I was confused, disoriented and exhausted. I was advised that as things weren't moving forward, I would need to start the syntocinon drip meaning the contractions would increase in intensity for approximately another 4 hours and I just couldn't do it, I'd hit a wall.""), ('0.5', ""I told the midwife I couldn't face it but the only pain relief left was an epidural (again previously didn't really want one and they knew this). At this point I would have chewed off my right arm for it to be over! 5am: Epidural started  and it was a game changer. I could see the contractions going crazy on the monitor but couldn't feel them (thank god!). My legs were heavy but I could move them.""), ('0.6', ""9:15am: I'm fully dilated but having no urge to push. The midwife tells me that things need to get moving due to the length of labour and risk to the baby. The consultant is going into theatre and will need to carry out an assisted delivery if the baby is not here by the time she returns (approx 1hr15). Between her and my husband, they coach me through approx 1hr 30 of pushing which was so difficult due to the lack of feeling due to the epidural and no natural urge to push. Around 10:30am: I am making progress but baby is facing the wrong way which makes pushing extra challenging so an assisted delivery was required.""), ('0.7', ""Again, not what I wanted, but by this point, I am DONE! I just want her here safely and I don't care how it happens. The consultant is able to attach the kiwi cup without an epistomy as she was so low. Pushing continued with assistance of the kiwi cup. I swear the consultant was pulling with so much force that she would have flown back across the room if her hand slipped 😂\n\nI then had to have an epistomy and although the epidural meant I shouldn't have, I felt it!""), ('0.8', ""So had a further local anesthetic injection (didn't feel it). This was one of my biggest fears and again, it wasn't even that bad. They began telling me her head was coming and after glimpsing down my husband looked at me crying and said he could see her face!!! 11:12am: She FINALLY arrives into this world and they pass her straight up to my chest.

Elio Aldan's birth story: natural hospital birth at 36 weeks with complications on my end but a healthy and sweet baby boy,"[('0.3', 'She kept me calm and kept me laughing and made my birth beautiful, and has spent today loving on my boy. Labor was relatively uncomplicated, if a little slow. My midwife created an incredible, safe, warm environment along with the doula. We were all talking and laughing, listening to music.'), ('0.4', 'I had a photo of my husband, the doula put it up for me. He kept me focused and comfortable. It was about 16 hours of labor before I was ready to push. Emotionally I felt really good until around then and the sadness and anxiety set in.'), ('0.5', ""It didn't help probably that I forgot all my prenatal class breathing and was shallowly hyperventilating in my mask, but I also just very intensely missed my husband, and I suddenly felt very unready to have a baby. I only had to push for about 10 minutes, and really just a couple of pushes, and then he was out, and not very happy about it. The first thing I noticed was his hair. My husband had an amazing amount of long black hair, and our little boy, to my happy surprise, was born with a head full of unruly black hair that I'm sure will grow into a mop like his dad's.""), ('0.6', 'We decided to delay cord clamping and I held him to my chest and snuggled him and told him how much I loved him, he latched and stared up at me with these big soulful eyes. I decided to name him Elio in those moments--with so much light and soul bursting out of him how could I not name him after the god of the sun? Everything seemed to be passing as though within a dream and even delivering the placenta was easy. everything just sort of happened in a very calm and easy way and it was a huge relief, until about 45 minutes or so after birth.'), ('0.7', ""I wanted to get up and the midwife and doula were both very encouraging of it. I felt okay, I reported that I felt a little dizzy and was told it was normal. I got up and walked down the hall with the doula and Elio, but only got maybe 10 or so feet from the room before I handed him to her and said that something was  wrong, and that's the last thing I remembered before I woke up in ICU this morning. I experienced a blood pressure drop and then began hemorrhaging.""), ('0.8', ""I am a little fuzzy on details and still very sleepy but unable to get the blood loss under control there was significant damage to my uterus, and conception of a future child is most likely compromised--although without my husband I'm done having kids because I am not remarrying.

Riley’s graduation story at 41 weeks-unmedicated hospital water birth- very positive,"[('0.3', 'I was in a lot of discomfort and the contractions were getting a lot worse. I had a lot of lower back labor pains with each contraction so my fiancé would rub my lower back as I kneeled down bent over the edge of the hospital bed during each contraction. At around 130 am I was pacing around the room between contractions when I felt a sudden and alarming burst from within and then water poured out of me, just like in the movies. After that my contractions got A LOT stronger.'), ('0.4', 'Luckily the birthing tub was almost full. Before getting into the tub my midwives did another cervical check at about 2:15, I was now at 9cm which shocked us all. I got into the tub by 230 and almost immediately felt a powerful urge to push with my contractions. I was most comfortable kneeled down against the edge of the tub and bent over the edge, gripping my fiancé’s hand as tight as I could.'), ('0.5', 'I told my midwives i couldn’t help but push anymore, they checked me again and I was fully dilated and baby’s head was super low, so low I could now reach in and touch it myself. Pushing during the contractions was intense... by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done. After pushing in my kneeling position for awhile my midwives said it may be more productive to just sit with my legs spread far apart so I switched to that. This made everything way more intense but within ten minutes of the hardest work of my life, my baby girl was born.'), ('0.6', 'My fiancé caught her coming out and put her into my chest. I was so taken aback by the entire experience, it was sooo much faster than I anticipated and much more painful but I was so proud of myself to sticking to my birth plan and not using any pain meds... not that I would have even had time for them if I had wanted them. Baby girl was perfect. Her heart rate stayed the same (140bpm) right from my admission, through all the stages of labor, to her arrival.'), ('0.7', 'My poor vagina didn’t fare too well- I have a second degree perineum tear and another two tears on my labia so I needed 3 stitches. While they stitched me up, baby girl enjoyed skin to skin with her dad. The entire experience was powerful and intense but I wouldn’t change a thing! I highly recommend eating six dates a day in your last trimester and drinking four cups of red raspberry leaf tea a day from 32 weeks on as I’m fairly sure that played a role in my quick labor.'), ('0.8', 'I also recommend reading Ina May’s Guide to Childbirth as the stories and tips from there helped me stay mentally strong throughout labor. Deep slow breaths are your friend, keep your jaw and lips loose, change positions frequently, and ride out each contraction like a wave bringing you closer to your baby. And no matter your experience, it is all so incredibly worth it when you meet your baby!'), ('0.9', '')]"
"Graduated/Birth Story: 41+3, induced/induction, epidural, vaginal birth, 48 hour labor, 6 days in the hospital, a little scary but very positive. Long read.","[('0.3', 'I labored on my own for a bit and got to 4cm dilation by 9:30pm, and then there was another manual stretch of my cervix. At 10pm they put me back on the Pitocin because my contractions weren’t ramping up. I decided that I wanted Stadol to allow me to sleep since clearly there was a lot of work left to do to get to 10cm, and I knew I needed my energy. In hindsight, this is the one decision I would not make in the future. It took the edge off of my pain, but while it was described as “a couple of glasses of wine” by multiple people, it made me higher than I have ever been in my life. It did lead to a nice conversation where I told my husband how much I loved him and how great he was being as a birth partner, so that’s a plus! He jokes that he doesn’t know what to do with women in labor, but he definitely knows how to handle high people, so he was in his element during this love fest. 😂\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sunday**\n\nAt 1:30am I was coming down from the Stadol, in pain, and shivering so hard my teeth were chattering. My husband woke up to me trying to get to the bathroom, totally tangled in my IV and the monitors which a nurse had accidentally hooked together. We called our nurse for help, and I asked for a cervical check.'), ('0.4', 'I was still only 4cm dilated and I knew there was no way in hell I would make it to 10cm and still have the energy to push, especially as my contractions were only ‘moderate.’ I was given the option of more Stadol or an epidural for pain management, which was then about an 8/10, and I opted for the epidural. My husband, the awesome birth partner, made me use my code word to confirm I really wanted the epidural, and I don’t think I have ever replied to him so quickly! At 2am two anesthesiologists came to insert the catheter while I was guided by a nurse. I felt very low emotionally at this point even though I knew it was the right decision. I intellectually knew that I wasn’t a failure, and I had been allowing for the possibility of getting an epidural even when I was hoping for fewer interventions, but I still felt like a failure. After the epidural was placed a catheter was also placed, and I was then in the bed for the rest of the labor. As others have said, the epidural is, frankly, absolutely incredible. It is a miracle. I highly recommend it if you’re on the fence. The only thing I would have changed about my decisions during labor would be to skip the Stadol and go directly for the epidural once my pain was ramping up.'), ('0.5', 'After the epidural was placed, the midwife was better able to pace the Pitocin to see what baby would tolerate while increasing the intensity of my contractions. At some point an intrauterine catheter was placed so that the intensity of the contractions could be tracked. I couldn’t see the monitors at this point, but my husband commented that it was incredible the amount of detail about each contraction that everyone could see. I was able to settle into sleep which was incredible. However, at some point during the night I developed a fever of 100.2. This was another scary moment, but thankfully they were able to manage it with Tylenol, so it never got any higher. My blood pressure also started to creep up at this time. At 10am I woke up and was 7cm dilated. I was back to about an 8/10 in terms of pain, and I labored in a few different positions with the aid of a peanut for the next several hours. While the anesthesiologists told me that I could “push a button” to get more of the epidural medication, they neglected to say that you actually had to hold the button down to get it to work, meaning I had been pushing a button for a couple of hours and not getting any additional medicine.'), ('0.6', 'This may have been for the best, though, as it meant that I would feel baby’s head better during the pushing stage. By 12pm I couldn’t handle the pain any longer. This was a pretty low moment where I was seriously questioning if I had the ability to go the last stretch. I asked my husband to repeat “you can do it” over and over to me, and then start repeating “I can do it” to drown out my doubts and psyche me up. (He was such an awesome birth partner from start to finish and I am really thankful for our communication.) I begged the nurse to start pushing even though I think I may have still been a bit early. She let me start, counting out three sets of ten seconds each contraction. I had a hard time feeling like I was progressing, but as more people came into the room and I got closer, it started to feel more likely that I would actually deliver. The epidural was turned off and the monitor for the contractions and catheter were removed. I pushed for one hour and with a final set of pushes, she was born and immediately placed on my chest.'), ('0.7', 'I never felt the ring of fire. It was the most bizarre and amazing feeling and I was so in shock that I asked if my husband could do skin to skin first since I wasn’t really processing things again yet. She was born at 1:04pm at 8lbs and 10oz, 21 inches, and she is gorgeous! The one more scary element of the birthing part is that the NICU staff were on hand as baby’s heart rate had been a little unpredictable. When she was delivered it was confirmed that there was Meconium in my amniotic fluid as well. However, baby was fine. We didn’t get to do delayed cord cutting, but otherwise there was no impact on the experience. The OBGYN then delivered the placenta and sewed up my two tears—a second degree perineum tear and a small tear on my left labia. We got our golden hour and baby latched and fed for 30 minutes. Then the OBGYN came back at 3pm to do a manual sweep of my uterus since I was still bleeding too heavily.'), ('0.8', 'I knew this would be painful, based on the descriptions others have shared, although thankfully it was only a minute long. This was the only time that I vocalized my pain, saying “please no” over and over, probably because I knew it was going to be over quickly! After that she administered more Cytotec rectally. Pretty soon after that I wanted to get up and use the bathroom, and I was up and walking around by 4pm after the nurse was sure the epidural had worn off. We were moved to recovery where we spent two days and nights, ultimately heading home after six days in the hospital. &amp;#x200B;\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nGoing to 41+3 was psychologically pretty brutal, weighing the decision of when to induce, the worry of stillbirth, and the desire to go into labor on my own. I was really active throughout my pregnancy, so I did feel somewhat let down by my body—although another way of looking at things is that my uterus was just too comfortable for baby to want to leave! In a way, it was a blessing that we induced for medical reasons as that decision felt that it was taken from me. I was the most disappointed in the changes to my desired birth plan when I got the epidural, even though I knew it was the right decision, and even though it allowed for me to deliver vaginally, which was my biggest goal after healthy baby and healthy mom. I was never able to really turn off the analytical part of my brain during labor, and maybe that contributed to my slow progression, but who can say.'), ('0.9', 'Ultimately, I am very happy with my birth experience, especially considering all of the scary things that cropped up but didn’t lead to bigger problems. At one week postpartum I feel fantastic; I have been mobile (although taking things easy) since my delivery, my stitches are healing well and I have more energy every day. In talking to my mother (a former labor &amp; delivery nurse) about my experience, she was filled with admiration for our birth team and the way in which they gave me space and let me labor, supporting me to achieve a vaginal delivery. Giving birth was one of the most intense experiences of my life. I am not eager to do it again soon, but I am looking forward to the next time already.')]"
Graduated 2/27 at 38w+6. Positive medicated hospital birth.,"[('0.3', 'They ended up needing to turn off my pitocin because my contractions were overlapping each other. At 9 PM they checked me again and I still hadn’t progressed, which was disappointing. The nurse said at midnight they’d check again and if I hadn’t progressed more they’d give me cytotec to try and help things along. Then what she said next really freaked me out. She said if I didn’t progress more by morning, there was a chance they’d have to discharge me because I wasn’t 39 weeks and they technically couldn’t induce at 38 weeks (which was SO confusing because at that point I was 38+6 and they had given me drugs TO induce labor... but she just wanted me to be prepared). This was the most stressful part of the experience because I was so terrified that I’d be sent home without a baby, and then I’d never know when to actually come in because I couldn’t feel my contractions.'), ('0.4', 'I didn’t sleep at all because I was so stressed out, and the fetal heart monitor was SO loud and I had to pee literally every hour, and I kept trying to walk around my room to try and help move things along. Also I was starving because I hadn’t eaten since 11 AM the day before. The next morning they checked me and I was so disappointed because while my cervix was more effaced, I wasn’t more dilated. Also still couldn’t feel contractions even though they had put me on and off pitocin all night. Luckily, my doctor must not have cared that I wasn’t 39 weeks because she came in and broke my water! It was the craziest feeling to have all that warm nasty liquid pour out.'), ('0.5', 'It’s hard to describe. People say it feels kind of like peeing your pants, but if that’s what peeing your pants feels like to you... sure. Now I could finally feel the contractions and I understood why people made such a big deal about how painful they are. I only felt them in my back and it felt exactly like my period cramps (I always get period cramps in my back), but times one million and SO painful. After about a half an hour with these cramps I asked for the epidural, and this experience was as bad to me as the contractions. The doctor took FOREVER and was having a hard time getting the right placement.'), ('0.6', 'It took about 20 minutes total of me sitting hunched over trying to stay completely still through contractions. It was terrible, and after 30 minutes of relief I could still feel contractions. Less painful for sure, but I could still feel them, I was very disappointed. I pressed the button a few times to have more relief, but I could still feel them sometimes. The baby must have descended more because I felt the worst pain I have ever felt in my life in my right hip that no amount of epidural would help. They tried turning me on my left side and propped up my leg, which only made the hip pain worse.'), ('0.7', 'BUT it sped up my labor like crazy and I was fully dilated and effaced about an hour later. The nurses had me doing gentle pushes with every contraction on my own for an hour to try and help the baby descend even more. At this point I was so scared that I wouldn’t be able to actually push her out because I was beyond exhausted and starving (I hadn’t eaten real food in over 24 hours at this point). Then the nurses came back in and I started pushing for real, and let me tell you, it was the most empowering experience of my life. Even though I was so spent, my body knew what to do and I was surged with energy. We only did about 3 rounds of pushes during contractions when I needed to stop otherwise the baby would be born.'), ('0.8', 'There was a little bit of chaos at this point because another girl who shared my doctor in the room next door was also pushing, and I guess there was some argument among the nurses about who was more ready to deliver (spoiler, it was me). There was a whirlwind of activity when the doctor and like, 10 other nurses came in to get ready for the birth. It was insane and I got a little nervous (I went from two nurses and my husband who were all very peaceful and positive to help me push to a room full of people who were all egging me on in a way that I could only describe as if I were playing a sport and they were very enthusiastic in their cheering. I preferred the peaceful pushing). After only about 20 minutes of pushing total, my baby girl was born! Unfortunately they had to whisk her away because there was meconium in her amniotic fluid, so I didn’t get to have immediate skin to skin or delayed chord cutting.'), ('0.9', 'She also had a fever of 102 and a heightened heart rate that no one could figure out because I didn’t have a fever. But it regulated after about 30 minutes and I was able to hold my sweet girl. I had a second degree perineal tear, but thankfully the epidural was working enough that I couldn’t feel the tearing or her emerge (just the horrible hip pain that went away as soon as she was born). Honestly the most stressful part of the experience was when I thought I might be sent home and the process of getting the epidural. I was in labor where I couldn’t feel contractions for about 19 hours, and then in active labor for about 7 and I pushed for about 20 minutes. I am amazed that my body was able to do what it is supposed to do, even while exhausted and hungry. I know I am SO SO lucky that so much of my laboring was painless. Overall it was a good experience (in retrospect. At the time it wasn’t so great), and I am SO grateful for our amazing nurses and that I have my healthy little girl!')]"

The second she stood up she said she had a very sharp pain from her cervix, up her spine, and to her brain. And it just exploded throughout her body. It felt like her bones were on fire and cold at the same time. She said she went actually blind from the pain. She fell back on to me while screaming ""put me back down"" over and over again.'), ('0.4', 'She was only wearing a nightgown and we saw blood coming down her leg. So my husband picked her up and put her in the back seat of the car. I got into the backseat and my husband got into the driver seat.

She was giving us instructions on how to hold it in until we can get to the hospital. Maybe 2 to 3 minutes of trying to hold it in she loss any color she had left and looked me dead in the eyes and said ""We are not going to make it"".

It dropped out of her and hit the parking lot ground. Didn\'t even need a push. I remember not wanting to hand over our baby to the nurses.

Graduated! FTM 40+3: Planned waterbirth turned hospital transfer (long),"[('0.3', 'Maybe like 7 AM. I was crying that I was just so tired and nothing seemed to be changing. They made me get out and try on the bed in all different positions. This was really uncomfortable and didn’t help. I was on my side, hands and knees, back, having my legs supported, doing it myself, all of it. I got back in the water but then they wanted to break my waters like 10 mins after I did (not sure why she didn’t say it before I got back in, or sooner, this was now like 4 hours into pushing). Moving around was difficult at this point with how quickly they were coming so it was frustrating because they would be hitting as I’m trying to switch places and climb out of the tub. Breaking my water didn’t really do anything except make me more uncomfortable because now fluid was constantly leaking everywhere. It also sucks because baby most likely would have been en caul, even the midwife said it, had they not (and things went “as planned”) which would have been so cool to see but I was trying everything they said would help her move. I kept being told they could see her head and hair and she was “right there,” but they said it for *hours*.'), ('0.4', 'I was also really upset because I was in so much pain and so unhappy I didn’t even want to look or reach and feel her head. I knew this meant I wasn’t okay anymore as I had been so excited for all those things. Like an hour after this point I just felt like something was wrong. The urges to push were convulsing my entire body in a way I will never forget. It honestly makes me shudder when I recall it. People say you forget the pain... but I truly don’t think I’ll ever forget that. I’ve never felt anything I can even compare it to. Like trying to go to the bathroom while constipated but at least a thousand times worse. It felt like my body was being split in two from the pelvis down. The midwife (they also switched shifts at this point, to one I had been hoping *wouldn’t* be on call) kept saying it was normal for first babies to take a long time but she was also acting like I wasn’t pushing and giving my all when I absolutely was.'), ('0.5', 'Tbh I was not happy with the two who were present at my birth, but thankfully my partner and doula were really amazing and supportive. I am beyond grateful for my partner, he was really the only one who knew how to help me best and comfort me and he was right by my side the entire time. But contractions were basically back to back and most lasting well over a minute. I wasn’t getting any break and I hadn’t slept since contractions started at 6AM the day before. And pushing was no longer just pressure, it felt like where my ovaries where in my pelvis were going to rupture. Which I kept saying. Now on roughly hour 6 of pushing, I had been saying for at least an hour that I couldn’t do it anymore and obviously nothing was working. Despite repeating “I’m not here to force you to stay” I really had to argue to be transferred to the hospital. I was begging for a c section at this point, I couldn’t take it anymore. It felt like something was wrong.'), ('0.6', 'I couldn’t lift my legs without help, couldn’t move my body at all, and was just continuously trying to push with nothing left in me and being asked to move into positions we had tried or let her put her hands where she wanted me to push and it was too painful. She finally agreed to get everything started for me but the contractions were so close and long it was the most miserable wait from that point and I couldn’t fight the urges to push so I was still trying the whole time. The hospital was thankfully like 5 minutes down the road but trying to stop myself from pushing plus leaking gushes of fluid every like 30 seconds was miserable. (My poor car seat, though at least leather). Not to mention there was now meconium, which happened as we were getting ready to leave and nobody told me. I heard them saying it to the OB when we arrived at the hospital around 10 AM. So now I’m also in pain and terrified and frustrated that nobody was keeping me informed about my own body. The staff at the hospital was so amazing though and they moved as quick as possible to get me set up for an epidural (which I always thought there was a point of no return where you couldn’t receive one but guess not???). Once that thing kicked in... everything was so much better. I didn’t feel her give it to me at all.'), ('0.7', 'Then you still feel pressure from contractions, but it was like nothing to me by that point and I could breathe through it again then eventually talk. And they slowed down significantly too. Baby was too low for a c section, they wanted me to push and use a vacuum. Turns out, baby was face up and tilted, landing her stuck under my pelvic bone, where she had been for some time. The OB said to me at one point “you couldn’t have pushed any harder, there was nothing you could have done.” Which I really needed. I agreed but asked for time to rest. They said yes, but let me know that baby’s heart rate was decelling. Her variability looked good, but it was still a significant concern and I couldn’t wait too long. Maybe half hour later they came back with some urgency and basically said I needed to start now and pediatrics where on their way, but they did it in a way that didn’t make me feel panicky but still I knew it was now. I had to wear oxygen for the baby and it just wasn’t registering at the time how bad things could have been (which is probably good or I’d have been a wreck).'), ('0.8', 'It only took like three rounds of contractions/pushing to get her out, she was born a little after 11 AM on the 14th. The vacuum and being stretched felt quite uncomfortable but was still much better than everything that had occurred before. I needed two stitches and she came out COVERED in meconium, and she wasn’t crying. They had made me aware she would probably need to be suctioned and put in the warmer, but it all started moving so fast after she came out. I just remember seeing this gray little baby being rushed across the room and not hearing anything and crying that I might have hurt her by waiting so long for the transfer, but then finally some very weak little cries. My partner couldn’t even really cut the cord as they had to take her immediately, but he did get to “trim” it at least. I didn’t get to have my first skin to skin until about an hour after she was actually born. Her apgar scores were great and she ended up being fine, just a bruise on her forehead from being stuck and suctioning that’s getting better everyday. Her head was a little misshapen at first but was fine by the next day. Baby is now sleeping very contently on her favorite spot (my chest) and even though it was rough and scary, every hour of pain was absolutely worth it for this.'), ('0.9', 'I do keep getting sad that things didn’t happen as I wanted and upset that it could have been worse if I didn’t trust myself and advocate for the transfer. Ultimately I wish it would have happened sooner, but I also discovered a physical strength inside I had no idea I possessed from the whole process and was reaffirmed to always trust my own intuition. I’m not sure if I’d try for the water birth again, only because of how long they let me go without thinking something could be wrong and them not being aware of her heart rate during the contractions. But I’m glad I did get the experience of knowing I *could* have done it.')]"

Felt a little strange but not really painful it was easy to stay still.'), ('0.5', 'My legs didn’t go completely numb like I was expecting but I definitely didn’t feel many of the constructions anymore.

I’m in NY where COVID was bad and is still present so I wasn’t happy about this but no one cared. They were like well the mom tested negative so he’s fine! At one point during recovery I was in so much pain I was whimpering throughout the night.

I am beyond shocked at the treatment I received at the hospital. Especially the 90 degree rooms with no fans.

I also had to break up with the homebirth midwife. Which felt like breaking up with a friend. I mostly just felt defeated. This pandemic has been so stressful. I’ve had to make so many hard choices about work and childcare while remaining calm and adult and watching idiots lick each other. Honestly, everyone has been so kind. Homebirth midwife knows many of the hospital midwives, was super supportive and I think a little relieved that she can just isolate and take care of herself. Everyone at the hospital was supportive and straight up said they understood. Also, the more accurate covid test came back negative. MASKS WORK, PEOPLE. *Back to the Hospital and labor*\n\nHospital midwife listened to our situation (we need to schedule something for childcare) and completely understood. She checked labor and delivery and they could induce me next Friday ooooorrrr tomorrow, 5:30am. We picked tomorrow because our babysitter has the weekend off. And that was that. We went from all natural nonintervention to scheduled induction in about 10 minutes.'), ('0.4', 'The hospital’s policy was that my husband could be with me, he just can’t leave and come back in. So once we check in and get tested, we are in. We have to wear masks whenever someone is in the room, but they are doing fewer checks than usual and a 24 hr check out if everything is normal. Babysitter spent the night with us that night, we walked into the hospital at 5:30 AM. Both got the covid quick test, both were negative. Pitocin was hooked up around 6:30, started low. Water broken around 7:30. Contractions were pretty chill. Did you know Comedy Central has about 6 hours of the Office on in the morning? I sat on the edge of the bed and laughed my way through an hour. They cranked pitocin up occasionally, but I never went over 10. Contractions started getting harder to sit through. But unlike my last induction, the contractions definitely peaked and retreated. I was able to rest and relax between. I forced myself to take a break, untense. After a while, I handled contractions by standing and “dancing” with my husband.'), ('0.5', 'It felt good to press my face into his chest and he did a good job of “rocking” me when the pain got heavy and I didn’t want to move. I tried to relax through the contraction. It was hard and took a lot of mental concentration, but I tried not to clamp my pelvic floor tight and relax my legs as much as possible. I took my stress out on my husbands chest with my head. I felt like this stage wasn’t that long, but also forever? I got mad at the office and turned it off. Contractions were about 2 mins apart, and I moaned through them. I got super nauseous at this point, but only during contractions. I should have taken that as a sign. It was about this point that I decided I might want an epidural, but kept telling myself “just wait after the next one”. I never felt “pressure”, but I could feel something change in my pelvis. When asked, I felt like I had diarrhea and was about to shit myself. It wasn’t “I have to poop” it was “I need to find a toilet because poop is coming”. This is when things changed. When the nurse heard this she said “do not try to poop on the toilet” and asked to check me. I couldn’t really lay down, but I noticed some of the other nurses started pulling in baby stuff - the warmer, the cart for the placenta.'), ('0.6', 'I looked around and said “wait, why is that here?” And the nurse laughed and said “you’re having a baby”. This had to be like.... 10:30am? It was reeeeally hard to lay down for the cervical check. I waited until between a contraction and sort of fell over. After this point I really felt like I couldn’t move. I had to be moved. She checked and said I was 8 cm, but the baby was right there. Then a bunch of nurses came in, I was NOT a lot of help. They were trying to stick pads under me and I couldn’t lift my pelvis. I think I had about two more contractions before it felt like I was pooping. That’s because I was pooping. I was hunched over on my side and told them I was pooping and someone said “no, you’re pushing!”\n\nMy husband helped hold a leg and the other midwife pushed it up near my head. So I was laying on my left side, my left leg sort of bent, my right leg being pushed up towards my head. One of the nurses told me to curl around my belly to help push.

Pushing was super surreal because all I could think of was “this is everything I’ve ever read”.'), ('0.7', 'Between contractions I could relax (sort of). As I pushed, I could feel her coming. I really couldn’t push outside of contractions. It’s crazy how the force of the contraction made pushing so much more effective. About 4 pushes in I could feel her crowning. The contraction ended and she was right there, so we hung out in the ring of fire. Mentally, I knew this was “good”, but god it hurt. I know I started whimpering “I can’t do this and it hurts too much”. The nurse said “She’s coming on the next push, take a deep breath and let’s do this”. I could feel the next contraction coming, warned everyone, and took a deep breath and just kept pushing. Suddenly the midwife was shouting “Look at me” and I said “Noooo” and my husband said “No, really, LOOK”. I looked down and there was a baby. She was super cheesy. They put her on my chest and we waited for the placenta. And it was... over. I asked for an epidural at that point.'), ('0.8', 'They called the birth at 11:26. So from water breaking to birth it was only FOUR HOURS. We got to order lunch. The placenta came out and that kind of felt good. I had a 1 degree tear and needed a couple stitches. And she’s here! She came out so fast her head is perfectly round. She’s healthy. I was up and walking around apparently too fast (I scared the nurse). I am grateful I didn’t have pain relief and got to feel all the stuff, but that epidural sure was nice last time. After all of the stress Covid has caused, it is actually a huge relief to have the birth over. My only advice for moms right now is to do what you feel safe doing. When homebirth no longer felt safe, I sucked it up transferred back to the hospital. I’m glad I did, because I know we are healthy and can go home and isolate again. I mean, also if you can get yourself one of those 4 hour labors, I highly recommend. Being pregnant during a pandemic sucks.'), ('0.9', 'I am so grateful it is over.')]"
"40 + 3 birth story (induction, hospital, unplanned c-section, sweet baby at the end)","[('0.3', 'So around 0900 we put the epidural request in and started hydrating me. I was stoked because the pain in my back already sucked and I knew I wouldn’t be able to cope with my water broken. The anesthesiologist eventually came and he is known for being the fastest at putting them in and he’s also been doing it for a very long time. I have helped so many women sit up for an epidural but I was super nervous about it myself. I mean super excited for the pain relief, but just nervous! I forgot to mention that since about 4 that morning I had been having some involuntary shaking, I don’t know if it was due to the pain, but it was pretty constant. So I was dealing with the shaking during the epidural as well and was trying to control it. Thankfully, It went really well. He was in so quickly, small pinch for the numbing medicine, pressure, some cramping in my back and then I could feel my toes feeling a little tingly. They laid me back and slowly but surely everything started getting so super numb.'), ('0.4', 'It was an amazing feeling to not have the back pain anymore! They put my catheter in and I felt some pressure from it but pretty soon I didn’t feel that either. They checked me said I was still a good two and that baby was coming down a little bit. They decided to turn me and put me on the peanut ball and let me rest for a bit. Not sure how much time had passed, but my doctor came and broke my water and said I was a good 4 and we had clear fluid. After they broke water they turned me to my other side and put the peanut ball under me again. At this point I had my husband update our parents who were the only ones we had told that we were coming in for induction. Then in a really quick moment, I feel like I have some shortness of breath, I thought it might have just been just a moment, but then I feel that same shortness of breath and I look up on the monitor and I see baby dipping into the 80s and I hear my coworkers coming to help me. I let them know really quick that I am having shortness of breath and they throw a pulse ox on me and see that my heart rate is in the 150s, my oxygen level is fine, but they also put some oxygen on me, it’s mostly to help baby recover but they are hoping it will help me too. I’m also involuntarily shaking again like CRAZY.'), ('0.5', 'I am looking over at my husband who looks terrified as hell and I’m trying not to freak out. Of course they think that my epidural went higher than intended and they do a test with something cold to determine that, so they cut it off for a bit. I’m also nauseous at this point and wanting to throw up but can’t. So they give me some phenergan and also they try a little bit of Demerol because we give that after csections routinely for shivering. It all hits me pretty quickly and it does seem to help somewhat. I am feeling less short of breath and my shivering is slightly better as well. At some point they do check me and I’m about 5 cm. They are able to turn my epidural back on but at a lower rate. I’m finally able to take a little bit of a nap here. I’m not sure for how long or what time is at all.'), ('0.6', 'I’m flipped and flopped on the peanut ball and at some point I start to feel some pressure in my bottom. I let them know this and they check new and I’m 8-9. So they turn me again on the peanut ball and not too much later I am feeling like holy shit I have to poop with every contraction. I call them in and I’m a 9.5 and my doctor says we can try to push past the lip. I say I would love to push and we get me all set up. So for me pushing just felt he because trying to do the kind of crunch forward and pushing down is hard to do when there feels like there’s no room to even move like that! But I’m pushing hard because my coworkers are having to clean up some poop (sorry guys) and they let me know I’m pushing right, but we keep pushing and it just doesn’t feel like I’m accomplishing anything. We get about an hour into it and my doctor comes into assess the situation. Not much progress has been made and it doesn’t seem like baby wants to come down or my cervix is changing. He also says that he thinks my pubic bone may be too narrow for baby and that this may be causing some of the conflict.'), ('0.7', 'He says he will do whatever I want to do. If I want to take a break or continue pushing or if I want to do a c-section, he will do whatever I want to do. At this point I am hurting so badly from the pressure in my butt, it feels like it is going to fall out and it’s past uncomfortable so I look at my coworkers who I trust more than anything and I tell them to tell me the truth and if they think that progress can actually be made or if it’s not worth it. They look at me and shake their heads and I cry and tell them let’s do the c section. I always knew it was a possibility, but it was still a little bit of a bitter pill to swallow. They turn off the pitocin. I feel like it takes an eternity for them to come and redone my epidural for the csection, but things are coming together and everyone is getting ready for the OR. They roll me back and it’s still so surreal being in a room that you’ve been in hundreds of times with people that you work with and see all the time and you’re the patient. They get me on the table and luckily the pressure has gotten somewhat better in my bottom and I am starting to feel very numb. My sweet nurse practitioner comes in who I saw for the pregnancy and I’m so happy she’s there!'), ('0.8', 'They have already started cutting into the skin because my husband is sitting next to me holding my hand and then there is some super rough tugging and pressure. That’s really the worst part is just you can’t feel pain, but the tugging is still really uncomfortable. And then all of a sudden we hear the sweetest cry from my little man and I am crying so many happy tears and so glad he’s here. My husband goes over to take pictures and I’m just not having a good time y’all, haha. I’m getting a little nauseous from all the tugging and just uncomfortable so as much as I didn’t want to just mostly from fear again, once my husband and baby go to the nursery I tell them to knock me out and before I know it we are moving me over back to my bed to go to recovery. Not too long after I’m back in my room, they bring my sweet baby to me and we do some wonderful skin to skin. That stuff is magical y’all and I fall in and out of sleep for a while. Postpartum so far as been as follows: \nDay 1: magical bliss of new baby, breastfeeding isn’t too bad, and some not so fun soreness from recovery\nDay 2: um holy hormones and clusterfeeding give this baby a bottle before I have a complete breakdown\nDay 3: we are home. Physically, it’s getting better everyday. my baby is getting a bottle, but I’m not losing my sanity and I am still going to try to do expressed breast milk.'), ('0.9', 'My baby is happy and fed and I am just so happy he is here and I want to continue to feel that way. I want you all to know that this whole thing is hard. And all of you are amazing no matter what you decide to do just as long as it’s your decision and you are doing it for yourself and your family. You can do this!! Surround yourselves with strength and if you can’t find it, you have got to reach out in some way, to a friend, a family member, or a support group.

The midwives and nurses were great about helping me do productive pushes to get her out without wasting energy.'), ('0.6', ""Her heart rate was dipping from being in the birth canal so long so they had me switch to side pushing.

My husband and I were real life versions of the heart eye emoji, she was just so gorgeous and perfect!! 7lb 1oz, 20.75 inches long. I had 2 small grazes that needed 1 stitch each, and they gave me a pitocin drip for some bleeding.'), ('0.8', 'We stayed at the hospital for 12 hours and then asked to be released and they let us go home with our baby!

Spent about an hour there and advanced from the ""this hurts"" stage to the ""oh fuck"" swearing crying phase.

St this point I had no sense of time).'), ('0.4', 'Did some directed pushing with the midwife helping me figure out where to push with her fingers.

There was a little light mecomium in the waters so they decided it was time to get this baby out!'), ('0.5', ""They helped me move to the birthing stool. I sat between contractions and held onto the ropes and squatted while pushing. Finally her head made an appearance! But then (though I didn't know it st the time) her shoulder got a little wedged in.

Also a note: I had meconium in waters with my first as well (also overdue) but the hospital didn't rush the delivery, just put NICU on standby and then suctioned her lungs when she arrived (no need for NICU). This time they didn't even need to suction and I'm convinced it is because they decided to get things going ASAP!""), ('0.9', 'Would HIGHLY recommend midwife led births (but please make sure you use CNM - certified nurse Midwives - or other well trained/regulated/professional midwives).

Graduated 10/7/2020 at 38+5. Pretty traumatic delivery and a return to the hospital 4 days postpartum.,"[('0.3', ""I couldn't sleep at all due to excitement, adrenaline, and anxiety, so I texted my mom and cousin (she's an overnight L&amp;D nurse at a different hospital) all night while my fiancé got some rest. At 8am, my OB (we will call her Nancy) showed up and checked me. I was 8cm dilated!! I was so excited but nervous. She said she would come back in an hour and I would probably be ready to go. Sure enough, at 9:20am, I was 10cm and she wanted me to start pushing. Here's where it gets traumatic. I pushed for FOUR hours. For the first hour or so, it wasn't bad. I couldn't feel the contractions except for some tightening or pressure so they would let me know when to push.""), ('0.4', ""In between pushes I was talking and joking around with my fiancé. Eventually, my baby passed my cervix and was in my birth canal. But he was stuck on my pubic bone. I pushed for another hour and at this point the epidural was barely doing anything for me. It was numbing my contractions but the pressure from him in vagina was so intense and the epidural did nothing for it. I felt like blacking out after each push. During breaks I would just lay there with my eyes closed because I had no strength. My fiancé and Nancy eventually told me that when I pushed you could see his head, but it would suck back up. At this point I was just sobbing and saying I couldn't do it. I legit thought I was going to die.""), ('0.5', ""Nancy said that I was making enough progress each time and at this point I had no choice. I just had to fight. I vomited once and was put on oxygen about 15 mins before I FINALLY passed his head and with one more push he was out and placed on my chest at 1:15pm. He cried for all of 5 seconds and then was just looking around. He was 7lbs 5oz, 20in long. He was beautiful and I sobbed and my fiancé sobbed and cut his cord. We cried more than our baby the first day we were in the hospital! Baby's first blood sugar was 85 which was such a relief! I tried to breastfeed and he did latch but we weren't sure how much he got. I had a third degree tear that was stitched up.""), ('0.6', ""More on that later. Fast forward to the next day and we get to go home as baby has had 3 normal blood sugars, I'm feeling okay, and his bilirubin number was at an acceptable level. We had been supplementing with formula and he had been peeing and pooping great! My third degree tear has been quite a bitch to deal with, but I was managing at home with Dermoplast, witch hazel pads, and ice packs. On 10/11 around 5am I sneezed and it hurt really bad. I was worried I tore some stitches but I just took some Tylenol and iced the area. I wasn't feeling awesome all day but nothing too concerning and attributed it to sleep deprivation. I took a nap with fiancé while baby slept and woke up about an hour later to tremendous pain in my pelvis that doubled me over and extreme pain in my perineum to the point I almost couldn't walk. I went to pee and EVERYTHING down there hurt so bad I started sobbing on the toilet. I managed to make it back downstairs and my fiancé was awake and saw me crying.""), ('0.7', ""I told him what was going on and that I was worried I tore my stitches and my pelvis hurt. I called my OB's on-call number and she said without looking at me she had no way of knowing but recommended ER. My fiancé said he wanted to take me considering how much pain I was in. I was crying and couldn't move without feeling like I was re-tearing and my pelvis was falling out. Even just standing still I would get sudden stabbing pains in my labia or vagina. I'm going to summarize this final part since this was super long, but I was immediately taken back to a room. I was sobbing and couldn't even open my eyes I was in so much pain. They got an IV in me and gave me pain meds and antibiotics as my temperature was 100.7F (I had a feeling I had a fever at home but our forehead thermometer said 98.7 or something. Piece of crap). The ER doc looked at my stitches and up inside me with a speculum and said I possibly had retained products of conception (RPOC).""), ('0.8', ""She ordered an ultrasound and there were things showing up but she wasn't sure what. She called Nancy who recommended I be admitted and seen by one of their OBs (went to a different, closer hospital). Turns out, I had a 9cm clot in my uterus and it was causing infection. She said my stitches looked fine, just slightly irritated. They gave me a medication to slightly contract, a ton of antibiotics, and pain meds.. and some Ativan for my anxiety and Benadryl to help me sleep. I slept so well after all the pain I had endured. I passed the clot overnight and they monitored me until 5pm the next day. I was so terrified of retained placenta and hemorrhaging and I was so relieved it wasn't that. I was also so upset having to stay alone in the hospital due to COVID and having to be away from my baby only 4 days after he was born. My fiancé held down the fort at home and his parents helped the next day.""), ('0.9', ""I was sent home with stronger pain meds for my tear and antibiotics. I'm following up with Nancy tomorrow. Overall, it was fairly traumatic for me. I have never had many health issues in my life and I have never endured so much pain over a short period of time. But my baby boy is here and perfect and it was worth it. It has however made me reconsider ever having another child haha. I just mostly want people to be aware the epidural only helps for certain kinds of pain, pressure is not one of them. Also, do perineal massage. I didn't and I wonder if it would've helped me. And finally, if something feels off, go to the ER. I went in worried my stitches tore, then found out I had an infection and huge clot. I also wanna say that despite how hard all of what I endured was, every nurse and doctor I encountered was absolutely incredible. They answered every question I had, they were prompt and returned when they said they would, and they were amazing at alleviating my fears. Thank you for reading, if anyone made it this far!"")]"
