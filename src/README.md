# Python Files
- **Path to corpus:**`birthing_experiences/src/birth_stories_df.json.gz`: compressed json file containing the dataframe of our corpus.
- **Pre and Post COVID corpus:** `birthing_experiences/src/pre_covid_posts_df.json.gz` and `birthing_experiences/src/post_covid_posts_df.json.gz` are compressed json files containing dataframes of the posts made before and after (respectively) March 11, 2020.
- `subreddit_dfs.py`: compiles all the submissions about birth stories that are 500+ words from all nine subreddits into one dataframe birth_stories_df, incorporates author's first comment for empty submissions, and saves it as a compressed json file.
- `imports.py`: all the packages we use in our code and reads the json file into a dataframe.
- `corpus_stats.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Table 1 and Figure 1 (left and right): finds statistics about the corpus.
- `subreddit_stats.py`: gets statistics about number of posts made per year for all nine subreddits.
- `labeling_stories.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Table 3: assigns labels to stories based on lexicon of key words, finds number of stories assigned each label. Also assigns "COVID" label to posts made after March 11, 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO, and separates the pre- and post-pandemic stories into two dataframes.
- `Topic_Modeling.py`: trains a topic model and plots topic probability over the course of the narrative for 50 topics.
- `Covid_Topic_Modeling.py`: plots topic probability over time for 50 topics (2010-2021).
- `Test_Sen.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Figure 2: sentiment analysis over the course of the narrative.
- `Personas.py`: Determines prevalence of personas in the corpus and plots distribution of personas over story time for any number of dataframes.
- `posts_per_month_during_covid.py`: finds number of posts made during each month from March 2020 to June 2021 and creates four separate dataframes for each era of COVID (March 11 2020-June 1 2020, June 1 2020-November 1 2020, November 1 2020-April 1 2020, and April 1 2021-June 24 2021). These eras were determined based on the New York Times line plot of number of new COVID cases over time.
