- `Sentiment_T_Tests.py`: performs t-test on trends in sentiment for posts made before and after COVID to determine if there are statistically signficant differences between them.
- `Test_Sen.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Figure 2: sentiment analysis over the course of the narrative.
- `labeling_stories.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Table 3: assigns labels to stories based on lexicon of key words, finds number of stories assigned each label. Also assigns "COVID" label to posts made after March 11, 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO, and separates the pre- and post-pandemic stories into two dataframes.
