"Long birth story of Emily, born at 38+1, STM, unmedicated home birth","[('0.3', ""In the following night I woke up at around 1 am to the strange sensation of something wet running down my leg. It wasn't much, but I was pretty sure it wasn't pee. I went to the toilet, peed and saw a really small amount of blood. Back in bed I couldn't sleep with thoughts about induction, c section and other interventions running through my mind. About half an hour later my son woke up and I went to check on him. He just wanted some cuddles so I went back to bed but now the Braxton Hicks contractions I had since almost the beginning of the pregnancy started to become pretty regular and a bit uncomfortable.""), ('0.4', ""My son came to our bed shortly after because he couldn't sleep and there I was, trying not to move around too much while my son was falling asleep next to me. As soon as he slept I stood up because I was just too uncomfortable and went to the living room. It was around 2am at this point. I spent the next hours alternating between pacing around, on all fours on the couch and lying on the couch to get some rest. The contractions were about 5 to 10 minutes apart and slowly increased in strengths but I was sure I was still pretty early in labor so didn't want to bother my husband or my midwife. The whole time I was binge watching a cooking show on Netflix to keep me awake and distracted between contractions.""), ('0.5', ""At around 7am I went to take a shower. The warm water was great but I really had to hold onto the wall and vocalize a bit when a contraction hit me. At this point I told myself that I would call the midwife once my husband and son were up and in their way to Kindergarten which was around 7:45 am. As soon as the midwife heard me having a contraction on the phone she said she'll be on her way. 20 minutes later she and my husband arrived almost simultaneously. I was moaning pretty loud by now and the contractions were about three minutes apart.""), ('0.6', ""The midwife checked me immediately and I was so surprised and relieved when she told me I was already at 7 cm dilated. It made me pretty euphorious actually and a bit proud that I had managed to get this far without help. A few contractions later I started to feel some urge to push, at which point the midwife got slightly hectic because she wanted me kneeling on the floor in front of the couch for the pushing phase. Now it got really uncomfortable. Not painful per se, just incredibly intense. I didn't have much time to rest between contractions and held onto a large pillow (I got really bad muscle soreness in the neck, shoulders and arms from that).""), ('0.7', ""I planned to not scream this time during pushing but couldn't help it, it was just too intense. The amniotic sac was still intact so the midwife opened it. I could feel the baby move down and the midwife checked regularly how she was doing and she was doing just fine, but the midwife still urged me to push a bit more because she didn't move much further for a few contractions. It didn't really worked so she wanted me to stand up in front of my husband with my back to him (this was not easy, my legs trembled a pretty bad), and with the next contraction she told me to go to a low squat and push hard. It was even more intense but I could feel that the changing of position worked. With the next contraction the head started to crown and I had to convince myself to push nonetheless.""), ('0.8', 'Two or three contractions with pretty hard pushing and whining from me the head was born and with the next one baby girl was here, at around 9am, which meant I pushed for about 30 to 40 minutes. The relief came instantly. I felt great, sitting down, cuddling my baby girl which cried immediately after being born. The midwife gave us a lot of time to cuddle before cutting the umbilical cord. I still had some contractions every few minutes which were not too bad but pretty annoying. The placenta was born after about 30 minutes I think and was complete.'), ('0.9', '')]"
Birth story [TRIGGER] how do I get through leaving my preemie in the nicu while I'm already home and heartbroken?,"[('0.3', ""So she puts the heart monitor on my belly and .... his/the baby heart rate is THERE AND IT'S NORMAL! I got there in time! I can't tell you the relief that gave me...I didn't care what happened to me, but please let the baby  be first priority! My OBGYN arrives in under 5 min and does a quick check of everything. I was already dialled to a 3 and 90% effaced.... BUT the prognosis was I had placental abruption... the placenta detatched from the uterine wall.... and I had to have an emergency c-section NOW!""), ('0.4', ""My husband was rushing from work to get there, but he wouldn't make it on time cause it was an emergency of course. He was crying and so scared to lose me and the baby... The nurses even said if I had been there 30 minutes later that we most likely wouldn't have made it. The doctors and nurses couldn't believe that this even happened, that it just does cause it's an anomaly,  even though my pregnancy was healthy the whole way through...\n\nthey had the anesthesiologist quickly put a spinal block in so I could see my baby being born thank God. Having a c-section was the weirdest feeling ever! A lot of pushing, pulling, tugging, pressure...I even felt it near my lungs it was really crazy!""), ('0.5', ""So baby comes out and I hear the sweetest littlest cries come out. He's okay and alive. That's all I wanted. His Apgar was a 9. He was 4 lbs 14 Oz and 19 inches long!

Ive only got to hold him/ do skin to skin once since hes been bornüò¢. And now i am home already, and had to leave him there, which I am so heartbroken about. It's like he makes progress, and then it's another step back day in day out... though yesterday they said he is improving.... I feel like I'm cut in half and can barely take care of myself the pain is so intense.""), ('0.7', 'So recovery has been and still is really hard on me... but the hardest part is not being able to have my baby home with me! I feel so alone and sad....I need him. It\'s not natural to not have your baby close and with you after birth! I mean they don\'t suspect him to be in there too long since he wasn\'t super early as some babies, but we still don\'t know WHEN because he has to improve and be able to keep a steady temp, feed normally from breast/bottle or both, fit in his carseat, etc.... so idk....\n\n\nAlso, my two older boys saw everything that happened until I was wheeled away for the c-section, and are kinda scarred from it so I feel horrible! Especially my 5 year old he told me "" I saw all that blood and didn\'t know what was going to happen to you mommy"" and he has been pretty emotional towards me.

"Graduated Dec. 21 - Major line jumper, guess whose due date was wrong? Happy unmedicated home birth!","[('0.3', ""I ended up hopping in my own bathtub and making my SO call the midwives to tell them I was trying to slow labor down. That sped it up. Birth assistant arrives, I'm leaning over my bed with every contraction. Midwives arrive within 5 minutes of each other. Dr. L is taking my vitals and I honestly don't remember much about that because I had my eyes SHUT. Contractions were right on top of each other already.""), ('0.4', 'Apparently I kept saying ""I just need a break"" over and over. The tub was finally set up and running and I practically sprinted into it. Instant relief, but it was only momentary. I immediately needed to push- and I did. I was actually drifting to sleep (for about 15 seconds) between contractions- I closed my eyes with daylight and opened them again and it was completely dark outside. Squatting in the tub also really messed up my hip because I was in a super weird position- SO was in the tub with me but I still couldn\'t hold on to anything well enough to bear down, even the tub wall.'), ('0.5', 'They got me out of the tub to avoid dehydrating me too much, as I was starting to get really really shaky (my face was even shaking). They ran an IV in my room. The contractions were so bad that I actually ENJOYED them placing the IV because it was distracting. Well, it turns out I had just the tiiiiniest cervical lip, and that was effectively sling-shoting baby back into me after every push and preventing any progress. So I ended up pushing for approximately six hours. So at this point a midwife goes ahead and manually pushes my cervical lip aside (oh my god, agony) and we get things moving.'), ('0.6', 'They actually got me up and had me on the toilet for a few pushes which is how I managed to get some crowning action before I got back in bed. I was kicking like a mule and wound up making the most progress on my back, which is generally considered WAY harder to birth in than side, squatting, etc- but so it goes. I actually had a birthing assistant play tug-of-war with a towel to bear down, and that\'s how I got most of his head out (giant cone head baby, naturally). SO guided his head out with flat palms, and at this point I was instructed to do small, controlled pushes to prevent any tearing. Once his torso was out, they told me to ""reach down and touch your baby"" and I HEARD ""reach down and GRAB your baby"" so I just grabbed that sucker under the arms and pulled him the rest of the way out and on to my chest, much to everyone\'s shock. Apparently that has not been done out of water before in the practice (because why would you!?).'), ('0.7', ""I wasn't really worried about though because I needed the placenta OUT OF ME. SO delivered my placenta and at long last, relief. Glorious, glorious relief. At 7lb 11oz, this kid is far from premature- He even scored 40 weeks during his check up. After 20 minutes he was breastfeeding like a champ. No idea how it got dated so wrong, but I'm a happy camper!""), ('0.8', ""He's absolutely lovely Totally worth it- I do wish I'd had a little more time in inactive labor so that things would have happened a little more gradually, but overall I'm just glad he's here!

baby D is here! our home birth story,"[('0.3', ""My midwife team (3 amazing ladies) showed up around 9:30pm, because the drive was so far they didn't want to take a risk of cutting it too close. Upon their arrival, they checked my dilation and I was at 6cm. They had me get out of bed and walk around the house while my husband set up the birth tub in our back yard underneath our apple tree (yes, I know hippy dippy, but it sounded like a romantic plan with candles and Christmas lights hanging from my apple tree. Haha) \nAnyways, after walking around and crying through contractions for another few hours, the birth tub was unable to be filled because my hot water heater decided to take a crap on us right when we needed it most! Thanks old-as-shit water heater...""), ('0.4', 'So, I decided just to labor it out in my bath tub inside the house. Contractions got to the point that just crying through them was no longer helping and I needed to scream them out like a wild banshee. About an hour of this and I was fully dilated. This was about 1am on the 20th. I got out of the bath and went to my bed, midwives checked my cervix and I was ready to go.'), ('0.5', ""I couldn't comfortably get my bearings to push while laying on my back. I tried pushing once or twice from the bed, when my water finally broke. After my water broke I told the ladies I would prefer to be squatting, so they helped me out of bed and I knelt down on my knees and started to push with each contraction. The baby was moving down the birth canal a fair amount each push, and I was able to reach inside my vagina and feel its head. (We had decided to wait until birth to find out the sex, which is why I'm still referring to it as an it at this point in my story).""), ('0.6', ""It hurt so bad I was biting my wooden bed frame I was kneeling over, and my bed now has several bite marks along the side, ha! I had my arms wrapped around my husband's waist who was sitting my front of me while I buried my face in his belly and screamed bloody murder with each push and contraction. I probably pushed like this about 5 times. The midwives asked me to stand as I was I able to push the baby's head out and with one more push while standing, I gave birth to a beautiful little boy. We immediately laid down on the floor, which the midwives had covered in waterproof pads and sheets for us.""), ('0.7', ""I was so happy to finally have him out and in my arms, I wasn't even concerned to find out his sex for another fifteen minutes when I finally thought to look while the midwives stitched up my minor tear. It was a super amazing experience and I'm so happy that I stuck through it to the end. Once I hit transition I was sure that my life was over and I was going to die right then and there. And I'm not going to lie, in the midst of pushing I cursed myself for deciding on a homebirth and not going to a hospital where they could freely administer pain relief drugs at my whim (although at that point it would have been too late anyways). I'm so proud of my husband for being my rock that entire day, and he never left my side.""), ('0.8', ""Actually, he left the room once to fill my water bottle and I swear the contraction I had while he was gone was a million times more painful because he wasn't there to hold my hand. So baby D was born at 2:36am on the 20th at 8lbs 11oz, and 21in long. This past week has been amazing, even on the night I held him and rocked him all night because he was screaming from gas pains because I mistakenly had eaten a spicy meal earlier that day without thinking about what it would do to my poor little guy's belly. Breastfeeding is going fantastic, and he's wide-eyed and curious about the world already. Our lives have changed for the better in so many ways since his arrival, and I'm so thankful we were able to do it our way without having to be transferred to the hospital.""), ('0.9', ""Thank you ladies for the 9 months of support, I couldn't have done any of this without you here to keep me company.

[Birth story] Planned home waterbirth turned hospital birth with a bit of a surprise.,"[('0.3', ""Midwife said to go for it and start pushing if thats what my body was telling me to do. Ive only been in labour 2 hours and I didnt fancy pooping in the pool, but fuck getting out. I start pushing like I am taking the biggest poop of my life. It felt a lot better than the contractions and that surprised me, but I found it really difficult to breathe while pushing. After 2 hours of pushing the midwife said she didnt think he was going to come out in the pool and told me to get out. I didnt want to so we tried a couple of pushes standing in the pool. I shouldnt be so stubborn, suddenly my legs start shaking uncontrollably, I think I am going to fall over. Husband and midwife help me out and over to a birthing stool. She wants me to try pushing on that for a bit, husband is behind me holding me up, I am shaking all over, naked and wet. I push and push and suddenly there is a head coming out of me. Im still feeling a bit high from the gas. I didnt feel the ring of fire. One more push and he is out on my chest. 'He looks like me and you mixed together' I tell my husband. Am I squeezing him too tight? Hes slippery and covered in blood.""), ('0.4', 'I dont want to drop him. 4 1/2 hours of labour. That wasnt so bad. Suddenly it sounds like someone has turned on a tap. I look down and there is red everywhere. My midwife tells the student to ring the emergency bell. Why is there red everywhere? Student is having difficulty getting the bell to work. I tell her you have to push it 3 times in a row. Hurry up student, the floor is messy. About 20 people rush in. I am naked, why are they all here? I dont want them all to see me naked. There are people either side of me. Someone is putting something in my leg, someone is putting something in my arm. My midwife is pressing on my stomach.'), ('0.5', 'Everyone is talking at the same time. They tell me to get on the bed. Someone takes my baby. They lift me onto the bed. I tell them to take my blood pressure. I dont feel so good. There are hands inside of me. There are hands on my belly. They are all pushing. Something is squeezing my arm. Everyone in the room is doing something in a hurry. Where is my baby? Why does my husband have his shirt off? They tell me he has to do skin to skin because I cant. Is my baby ok? They tell me I have lost a lot of blood.'), ('0.6', ""I hear the word 'ICU' and they say I need emergency surgery. They are going to knock me out. I tell them no. I had this baby without medication (well a bit of gas) and I dont want any now. I am afraid I wont wake up. They say they can give me a spinal instead. Someone tells me the blood is from a 3rd degree tear, a tear in the babys cord and from the placenta coming away. They are giving me IV fluids. Someone is cleaning the floor. Someone is pushing me into the OR. I ask if he is having a good day. He tells me its been ok. Thats nice. I tell him where to go. He says he knows where to go.

My heart keeps racing. They say they think I might have PTSD. The next day is a blur. I eventually discharge against medical advice. This place is freaking me out. I need to get home. Things get much better once we got home. Eventually the PTSD subsided after a couple of weeks  and much talking it through. I dont get flashbacks very often anymore and I can now think back on the birth positively. Everything has healed up and me and baby boy are doing really well.

"Birth story: spontaneous pre-term labour, far from home","[('0.3', ""I was having contractions just a few minutes apart. Baby was coming, and soon. They gave me steroids for the baby and magnesium sulfate and something else that I still don't remember, but it made me feel very hot. The goal was to slow down labour long enough for a pediatrician to come from another town, or better yet for a paediatric team to make it from the city. Things were moving too quickly for a medical evacuation to be safe.""), ('0.4', 'They were pretty pessimistic about the situation. I was taken down to the delivery ward and they tried to keep me calm and still. I got instructions like ""if you feel the need to push, don\'t."" I was offered some gas and my husband (who was even less prepared for this whole labour thing than I was) did an amazing job alternating between helping me with the gas during contractions and giving me sips of water between them. In the brief gaps between contractions the midwives tried to reassure me.'), ('0.5', 'It was like I was having my head held underwater, then coming up with just enough time to catch my breath before being pushed under again. The contractions began to run into each other, and the obstetrician began to be concerned about impact they were having on baby. The pediatrician arrived at 7:07am, and the obstetrician promptly broke my waters. A few pushes got baby down into position and crowning, and one last push delivered our little boy into the world at 7:20am - all in one go, like he was being shot out of a cannon. Thankfully no incision or tearing, even coming out posterior facing.'), ('0.6', 'Baby was moved onto the station that had been set up. They told me he was a boy, and I had a moment of gender disappointment knowing girls have better outcomes at this stage. Thankfully they were able to get him breathing as I delivered the placenta at 7:25am. We got about a minute of skin to skin, then I was rushed away to recovery while they worked on him. The medevac team arrived not long after and stabilised him over the coming hours.'), ('0.7', 'I was basically left to my own devices in my room, as the hospital was not staffed for the drama. Thankfully, physically I was in excellent shape. At about 1pm we were taken to the airport, where I sat in lost-and-found pants and a hospital gown to wait for the plane and my baby in the ambulance. My husband was loaded into the cockpit and me onto a stretcher at the back of the plane, with baby in his humidicrib with three medicos working on him. We were evacuated just before a storm rolled in.'), ('0.8', ""A dramatic start to life for our little man. We were both admitted to a major hospital with the best NICU in the state.

Emotionally, now that's a different story.""), ('0.9', ""But our little boy is doing as well as can be hoped for - breathing on his own (with CPAP) and taking some milk (through a tube).

Belated (almost)homebirth story of Alexander 04-09-'16 (birth pictures added) reeaaally long.,"[('0.3', ""We don't have an OB present unless you're in the hospital. One midwife has medical training, the other is an assistant to both her and you during the labour) who showed up quickly. It was a very sweet older lady who made me feel incredibly comfortable. The entire club was complete at this point and now all we had to do was wait for Alexander's arrival. When midwife2 showed up my contractions had gotten horrible. I was about eight hours into my labour at this point. I hadn't moaned, cried, screamed or done anything other than breathe away my contractions for all these hours. But suddenly I couldn't keep quiet and had to scream through one. The pressure was absolutely intense. The only way I can describe the sensation of transition is to compare it to how your stomach contracts during a violet bout of vomiting. That vice you feel when you gag, but ten times worse and aimed down rather than up. It felt like my hips were trying to make their way out of my asshole. Not that my asshole was particularly painful... just that everything was trying to go down. Now that I look back at that, that was my baby descending quite violently. I went into transition just like that, though sadly at eight centimeters which meant I couldn't push just yet.""), ('0.4', ""I had to breathe/scream/moan and at this point violently puke my way through these contractions, rocking back and forth while sitting on the couch. This was the only way I felt remotely comfortable. I squeezed the living fuck out of my partner's hand (who even though he'd not smoked for weeks, went out for smoke-breaks due to stress - that asshole), and would squeeze midwife2's hand whenever he was away. I just asked her if I could, and if she could motivate me through words. She told me she was amazed I had the guts to even ask her that. But it was what I needed. Take what you need ladies! Between contractions the midwife would check my dilation, and when I was finally at a solid ten I was allowed to push. Seriously ladies, once you are allowed to push things get so much better. The pressure relieves almost immediately once you push along with them and was almost not painful for me anymore. Here's when things went a little less good. I had been pushing for two hours. And he just kept sliding back. He'd gotten stuck behind my pelvic bone, I was exhausted and not pushing right and things were just not happening. They had me hold my own legs as I pushed on my back, laid me on my side and had me push like that.""), ('0.5', ""Even put me on all fours and had me do it like that, all the while Alexander's tuft of hair just kind of sat there not moving anywhere. He'd also pooped as my amniotic fluid started to turn brown...\n\nAt this point the midwife had already called the ambulance, but I had no idea. She told me she would call them about two minutes before they arrived, which was a very smart way to keep my nervousness at bay. I was wearing nothing but a tanktop when I was dragged onto a stretcher and burritoed into a blanket and strapped in. I honestly thought I'd be more embarrassed about my nakedness, though my boobs could've been flopping about and I wouldn't have cared. I just wanted labour to end, I was really tired. The ambulance ride was a little bit awesome, which might sound weird. I had never been in an ambulance in my life and it had it's sirens on, disregarding traffic rules and everything. My partner was in the front and though he was worried, also had a blast. Not often you get to rie one! I was wheeled up to a delivery room and crawled onto the bed. My legs were put in stirrups and they put an IV in my hand to start administering something to intensify my contractions. Though things were progressing incredibly fast from that point onward, making it so that I had no need for any medications and the IV was for nothing (bahhhh!). The shaking in the ambulance had helped Alexander pass underneath whatever he was stuck on, and within twenty minutes I could feel what they call 'the ring of fire'. Honestly it didn't hurt that bad.""), ('0.6', ""It was kind of like pooping out a big poop and your asshole screaming at you not to. I just pushed through the pins-and-needles sensation and could feel the exact moment when his head came out. one second later the rest of his body followed and he was placed on my chest. He came out at a good 3985 gr... I forgot how tall he was! Honestly I was a little disgusted and even though I thought I would, didn't feel a sense of overwhelming love. He was incredibly warm, wet, with sticky vernix and poop all over his back. My chest was stained with blood, poop and... bah. I was just happy it was over. He was born about a quarter to two the afternoon after my water broke. A relatively short labour for a first baby according to my midwives. They took him away to get him clean, get his APGAR scores, weight and height and clothes. I missed this entire process as I was just too tired to pay attention. I was also being stitched up as I had a second degree tear. After being stitched I was helped out of bed to take a shower, and this was the moment I realised how absolutely awful I felt.""), ('0.7', ""I was absolutely exhausted, starving and nearly unable to balance myself on my jellylegs. I tried to shower on my own first but eventually caved and asked a nurse to help me wash myself. I was shaking and pale and... ugh. I hadn't even looked at my baby properly yet, I just wasn't ready. The nurse helped me dry off but the second I took a step I just started bleeding again, covering the entire shower. It was horribly traumatic for me to be standing there, already having a poor self image due to me being overweight with floppy breasts and massive stretch marks, violently bleeding out of my vagina and being washed and dried off by a stranger. This was NOT the calm, peaceful homebirth I had in mind and it made me a little sad. Once I had some clean clothes on and a thick pad in my underwear, I returned to bed and tried to breastfeed my baby. I was still starving and shaking from exhaustion, which made me unable to put in a great effort. I just couldn't get him to latch and I was getting frustrated. I had absolutely no intention to start formula feeding as I was well-informed about it taking a while for my milk to come in, potential weight loss in my baby and yadayada. I was determined to make this work so I had a nurse fetch me a nipple-shield. After two hours we finally got him to latch for his first feed. When he fell asleep I could finally eat. At around five thirty my father picked us up with his car (we don't have one).""), ('0.8', ""I had Alexander on my lap in his car-seat, a baloon with 'It's a boy' on it strapped to the handle (my partner and father bought this for me as I was being taken care of) while riding in a wheelchair. Seeing the way other patiens and visitors looked at me with endearment and compassion made me feel so much better. I started to feel proud. The following ten days were a very fun period for me. In The Netherlands we get what is called a 'kraamverzorgster' which just translates to nurse according to google translate (literally it's like birthing-caregiver or something like that), to take care of the mother and baby for about a week. She taught me how to bathe Alexander in his tub, change him, dress him, hold him etc. I barely held Alex during that time because he was so small-looking. I was afraid I'd break him! My caregiver was incredibly friendly and understanding of my desire to breastfeed. Even though he started losing a worrying amount of weight, we still pushed on to get him to latch right and drink effectively. He was a very sleepy baby and would fall asleep after a couple of minutes. He was also very difficult to wake up! I also have gigantic 85N boobs which would completely smother him unless I held them up while feeding. It looked like it wouldn't be going anywhere. Eventually he had lost ten percent of his birth-weight which was a little scary.""), ('0.9', ""My caregiver recommended my partner to buy me a manual breast pump to at least bottle-feed him some milk during our attempts to get this breastfeeding thing under control. Pumping extra caused my supply to go up tremendously which made my boobs ROOCKK HAARDD for a day. I pumped them emptyemptyempty once and the next day they had chilled out. Baby was also putting on weight again with the extra bottle-feeding. Now it's been 11 weeks and five days since the birth. I can't believe he's almost three months old already. He's a chubby baby now with a lot to say, a lot of poop and a lot of drool. We've mastered breastfeeding and he's gaining normally which is an incredible relief. He was a champ during his first few vaccinations (never suffered anything more than the initial jab) and is just a happy baby overall. I could not be happier!"")]"
Maya's birth story - at home water birth,"[('0.3', ""But she was OP and on the next contraction she shot across the pool. Along with a massive bloom of blood that followed. As planned, my wife caught the bub and it was when she brought it to the surface that we found we were having the girl we'd hoped for. Absolutely perfect in every way.

We found out later that she'd torn fairly massively inside the birth passage and severed an artery. They lay my wife down and tried to find the source of the bleeding, which didn't look terrible at this stage. But the placenta wouldn't birth. I thought that the big red chunky things they were filling a surgical tray with was the placenta. Turns out it was blood clots. They tried syntocinon and another drug and had started on further active management of the third stage when my wife turned white, started fitting and lost consciousness.""), ('0.5', ""She came to fairly quickly, but we'd already called the ambulance while the midwives phoned ahead to the hospital.

They relaxed after that. While they took her to the hospital, I followed driving my newborn. She was so quiet and calm I had to keep stopping the car to check she was ok.\n\nMy wife had convulsed twice more on the way up and the bleeding had started up again.

If she cried, I let her suck on my pinkie (properly cleaned, of course) which soothed her. In fact, she barely cried at all, just looked about, slept and sucked dad's finger. My wife came out of surgery at about 10:30 or so - three hours after she'd given birth and Maya was finally able to have her first feed.""), ('0.7', ""Turns out that her placenta would not detach for the docs either - drugs didn't work, active management, nothing.

She stayed in hospital until yesterday after having a transfusion the day before. She's exhausted and sore. But our little girl was born 4.05 kilos, 54cm long and is an excellent feeder. She's calm, happy and alert and loves cuddles.""), ('0.8', ""And despite the trauma of the birth, it's excised the lingering pain over my son's birth - even though it didn't go as planned, we knew the risks and understood the ramifications of our choices. It made it easier that this was our choice, rather than something that was forced upon us. The labour was easy and beautiful, the bub came out pink, calm and happy - a far cry from the induced birth of my son. We had a great midwife team who knew when to pull the plug - and called ahead, speaking personally to the doc at the hospital so he knew what to expect. Would I advocate for homebirth? Absolutely - in low risk pregnancies with an experience and qualified midwife team and a nearby hospital. Would I want to do it again?""), ('0.9', ""I think my wife is now firmly high-risk.

I don't know if I'd describe them as all pain, more so than an intense pressure that was consuming, with a painful undertone. I kept focusing on the fact that the contraction would end and to just make it there. When we came down from the bath, Nancy checked me again, and I was at I believe, 7cm and she decided to work the scar tissue again. This was around 4am, and it was the fucking worst. But she got it to release I continued to labor on the couch for another 2 hours. At 6am, she broke my water, which pushed me to 10cm, and shit got real as I hit transition hard. I remember asking her if it was going to get worse (she said no) and if she thought I'd be in labor another 12 hours....or 6 hours....or 4 hours....I was starting to get into my head pretty hard about the process.""), ('0.4', ""I was using the stairs and yoga ball to cope with the contractions at this point and I was just consumed by the horrible pressure and pain. My husband started filling the large birth tub in the living room and I was experiencing intense sweating and heat so I didn't want to get in it when it had filled enough. I kept asking if ice could be put in it, lol. My husband and sister kept bringing cold rags for my neck and body, trying to cool me down. The contractions at this point literally consumed me. I was gripping the tub and pushing against it with my feet in an effort to ride the contraction and looking back, I was fighting them instead of letting go, but honestly I couldn't have done differently, the intensity of what I was feeling just overwhelmed me, but true to what I'd been told, when you feel like you can't do it anymore, you're almost done. I was totally taken back by how much painful pressure I felt in my butt, and I was very vocal about this. My midwife then had me get out of the tub so she could apply better counter pressure and to try the stool a bit before using the tub again.""), ('0.5', 'I asked her if she thought I could just get out and not have to get back in, did she think I could have the baby without having to get back in the water- I was really focused on benchmarks, lol. I got out of the tub and she told me to get on all fours, which felt impossible, but she was great and told me basically to do it anyway, which I did, and I labored like that through 3 contractions while she and my sister provided counter pressure, which was very helpful. I was super overwhelmed with how I was feeling, and the adrenaline from transition was really difficult for me, I was sweating buckets and so damn hot. At this point, my midwife wanted me to get on the birth stool with my husband behind me on the couch and she asked if I wanted a glass of wine to help chill out a bit before we started pushing, I was really overwhelmed with all the sensations. I asked her if I could have a shot of whiskey instead, so my husband brought me a shot of Wild Turkey and then we got down to business. Pushing was incredibly difficult. I had expected to feel progress of the efforts, but it was all just one tremendously overwhelming feeling of pressure throughout my entire pelvic region coupled with having to expend an almost supernatural strength in bearing down. I felt the contractions and efforts of pushing everywhere in my body.'), ('0.6', ""Continually looking for benchmarks, I asked my midwife if it would be over in ten contractions, and she kindly laughed and replied that if I made them good ones, but that was up to me. Nancy was amazing and lead me through how to push, how to make use of the strongest contractions, and when to back off to allow try to prevent tearing. She was kneeling in front of me, applying warm compresses which had been warming in a nearby crockpot. She was also liberally applying oil and helping to ease the skin. This was really hard work, literally the toughest thing I've ever done. I felt like I couldn't do it through most of it, but everyone there in support of me kept encouraging me and tending to me, that I was doing it anyway. I occasionally stood up and stretched during this, in between contractions, which felt good, and I was surprised I was able to do at this stage of labor. My midwife asked that I shimmy off the stool a bit and do a proper squat, to which I was like no fucking way, anything that increased the pressure was unthinkable!""), ('0.7', ""But then she told me the effort of one push there could be equal to 10 pushes on the stool, so I dropped and did it. I got back on the stool and Nancy told me to put my hand on my vagina to feel the stretching on top, in an effort to not tear and push to much. I was spent at this point, even though pushing start to finish only lasted an hour and a half. My sister was telling me how much she could see, and told me she could see the hair of the baby poking out. The next few pushes are a blur, she hadn't crowned yet and then all of the sudden, she came out completely in one big push. I was shocked both by it happening so quickly and by the full head of hair on our baby. I was in utter shock and disbelief at what we had just accomplished and I looked down at our daughter, Golden Elizabeth in awe. My husband was wrapped around me and put his hands over mine and we gazed at our baby in utter delight and surprise.""), ('0.8', ""My sister had been and was continuing to snap pictures (which I had said I didn't think I'd want, but I'm glad my midwife had told her it was time to grab the camera when she did). Nancy had me focus on the next contractions so we could delivery the placenta. I asked her if it would hurt again and she told me no, it would just feel like a wet burrito sliding out. I gushed what I thought was a ton of blood into the waiting bowl beneath me and probably within those first ten minutes, delivered the placenta. From there, I made my way to lying down on the couch, skin to skin with Golden as we waited for her to latch. It was such a surprising and lovely sensation, to have labored and delivered our baby in the living room with such intense energy, and for that then to dissipate as we all settled in awe and wonder. Nancy massaged my uterus which was also not the greatest, but she was making sure I was contracting smaller and that I didn't overly bleed. When it was time to cut the cord, my husband commented that it was a lot more difficult to cut through than he expected.""), ('0.9', ""Once this was done, Golden went to my husband for skin to skin while Nancy and my twin sister tended to me. In between them during all of this was my dog Norma, who calmly and diligently offered her presence in comfort through the entire labor. Nancy let me know that she needed to check if my tear needed stitches, which I was surprised to hear, because I had no idea I'd torn and couldn't feel that it'd happened. Nancy decided to do a few stitches, it was a second degree tear at the bottom of my vagina. Once I was all set, I was led upstairs to a drawn bath with all the herbs Nancy had made a strong tea with (I don't recall everything that was in it, but it had a good deal of powdered clove, which turned the bath water a dark murky brown). I got in the tub and lounged like this for a while, which is when my mom arrived and joined me on the bathroom floor, telling me how shocked and proud she was. Once out of the bath, I got in bed and my husband brought me Golden and we settled in. I'm writing this on the one week anniversary of when I went into labor, and I have been enjoying staying on somewhat bedrest up with our new baby and my husband. Giving birth was one of the most tremendously intense experiences of my life, and I still find myself in disbelief that I did it.

The water took the edge off and helped relax my back (I think I'd strained a muscle in it earlier), but I don't think I'd need to have the full-on tub experience if I ever go through labor again. After a while in the tub, it became clear that baby wasn't really descending (though heart tones were fine), and they had me get out of the tub and push with the assist of gravity.""), ('0.5', ""After a second cervical check, they decided my full bladder was in baby's way, so they catheterized and emptied it.

But that wasn't to be, because with the next push Linnea came fully out, head, shoulders, and body - and all over the carpet, because they weren't quite ready for her emergence so swiftly although they did catch her. Now we have a lovely new area rug in front of the couch downstairs!""), ('0.6', ""She was born with a huge caput (big bruise) on the left side of her head, so she'd been bumping into something while inside for a while. I ended up with a partial third degree internal tear and a technical hemorrhage, so had to leave after a couple of hours and get stitched up in the OR at the hospital nearby. That was perhaps more painful than labor, because they were all up in my vagina and rectum (the muscle and fascia between is where most of the tearing happened). I only accepted lidocaine so felt a lot of very intense pressure for the hour they were stitching. My husband was left all alone at home with Linnea during that time, and was a pro at soothing and caring for her right away.""), ('0.7', ""In retrospect, it's been funny to me that going into the process I told my midwives and doula that I wanted lots of information and to always know what was going on. When it played out in the moment, they didn't tell me a lot of things such as that my labor pattern was unpredictable and hard to read, that I was almost fully dilated at the first check, or when I was hitting transition. Instead, they attended to me but let my body and my own instincts kick in - and that's actually just what I needed. They were an amazing support team and I wish everyone could have such fantastic people around them for their birth, no matter the setting. In terms of the first couple of weeks, they've been up and down.""), ('0.8', ""Linnea had a very obvious tongue tie, so breastfeeding was very painful and stressful that first week.

But after we got her tie released five days post-birth, breastfeeding improved and I'm feeling *much* better both mentally and physically.

I don't even feel there was time to go into myself and when I did, I didn't want to be there. Everything escalated so quickly. While I was pregnant I told myself I was going to try and make my contractions as productive as possible. I was going to be proactive and push myself and knew it would be more painful, but the pain was a positive thing, it would bring my baby to me.

My husband was able to keep me breathing and calm through about one more contraction and that was it. I started to shake uncontrollably with every contraction and had to be reminded about my breathing, I was beginning to hyperventilate. I started having the urge to push so I asked for a pelvic exam. It was very difficult to lay down because of the pain it caused, but I learned I was about 7 1/2-8 cm dilated. It was 4:30 at this point.

After a contraction I felt something dripping down my leg, I lifted my night gown and asked my husband what it was, I could see it though, I was starting to bleed. The contractions keep coming and I kept pushing, there was more blood and small chunks of something sliding down my leg. I could see the midwife was concerned and she started asking questions about my placenta and if i was ever told something, i don't remember what she asked, but I didn't have time to answer, another big contraction came and broke my water. My husband's and midwife's socks were soaked. The baby's heart rate was being monitored the entire time and everything looked good.

I didn't understand why she was rushing me, she wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I tried pushing but felt like my body was doing nothing, absolutely nothing and a contraction just wouldn't come. I told her this and again she told me to push as hard as I could and to get the baby out. So I did, I pushed as hard as I could without a contraction and two pushes later, she was born.
