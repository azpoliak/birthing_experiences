Birth Story: pain-med-free hospital birth with pitocin,"[('0.3', ""I felt like things were definitely moving along at this point. But she said yes we do, and I didn't push the question any further. Labored a bit on the toilet and had a bowel movement. I was feeling increasingly tired between contractions, and a little nauseous. I moved to the bed laying curled on my side because I was just so physically tired! It felt a little like having the flu, when your muscles are shaky and weak. The contractions were getting very intense. I was trying to breathe through them and relax, but after a while I felt like I wasn't able to relax at the peaks anymore.""), ('0.4', ""I was moaning out loud. Luckily they weren't coming that fast (midwife said afterwards it was about every 3 minutes). But I felt out of control and like I wasn't coping well, and decided eff this, I want an epidural. I was still laboring on my side in bed for what seemed like a good while after the nurse put in the order. Then she came to tell us the anesthesiologist was held up in the OR. She offered IV narcotics. I told her I already felt sleepy and nauseous, so meds to make me sleepier, potentially more nauseous, and not necessarily do much about the pain sounded awful. A while later the midwife came to check on me.""), ('0.5', ""She had me get out of bed and back on the birthing ball, which I was super not interested in doing (so tired- moving was hard!) but actually did end up being a slightly better position for handling the contractions. Then we were told a CRNA was available to place an epidural if I still wanted it. At this point I hadn't had my cervix checked since I had been admitted the night before. The midwife asked if I wanted her to check my cervix before the epidural, if I would potentially change my mind about it if I was far enough along. I wasn't being very decisive, because I really just wanted to not have to feel the contractions anymore, but I knew logically that if I was at a 9 or 10 that the epidural wasn't likely to be helpful anyway. So we went for the check, and lo and behold I was a 9 and almost time to start pushing! So much for that epidural!""), ('0.6', ""Looking back, the point that I decided I couldn't take it and requested the epidural was probably transition. In my crunchy natural-childbirth dreams, I figured I'd push either squatting or maybe have a water birth. In real life, getting off the ball and back in bed for the cervical check was exhausting enough, squatting was totally not happening. So I ended up on my back with my husband and a nurse holding my legs. For me, pushing sucked! It was hard, plus it hurt! The midwife was telling me push! And I was moaning nooooo, I don't want to!""), ('0.7', 'She offered me a mirror to watch and I said no. Eventually she convinced me to reach down and feel his head, which did motivate me - I figured if he was that far it couldn\'t hurt any worse to get him all the way out! So I buckled down and he was born at 11:15am. The cord was looped around his neck which apparently was no big deal. He did also have a true knot in his cord, which we hadn\'t known about and potentially could have caused a problem during the pregnancy. So probably lucky that he came a little early :)\n\nThe nurses had put towels on my belly so they wiped him off right there and then we got skin-to-skin on my chest right away. My husband cut the cord, and the midwife was a little overexcited about showing him the placenta after I delivered it (""Do you want to see the placenta?"" ""No not really"" *holds it up* ""Look, here\'s where the baby was attached, and here\'s where it was attached to her..."" *husband making polite face*).'), ('0.8', 'Luckily, no tears! Just a few ""skid marks"" that didn\'t require stitches. Overall it was a positive experience. It was very fast and very intense! I wonder if things would have progressed so fast if we had slowed down the Pitocin - but on the other hand if transition was going to be that painful either way, I\'ll take the shorter labor leading up to it! Postpartum: breastfeeding is working really well for us. The first few days were a steep learning curve but we both caught on with help from the nurses. If you\'re planning to breastfeed I definitely recommend doing a bit of research beforehand so you know what to expect, and not giving up too soon.'), ('0.9', '')]"
Lennox's birth story. Honest and maybe not the most positive hospital forceps assisted birth but really awesome baby at end. :),"[('0.3', 'I also had what was considered the “perfect” epidural because I could still completely move my feet and it only numbed my uterus area and butt. I feel like I could have walked if I wanted. The nurses were SUPER happy with how it worked out for me. I was able to sleep and didn’t feel a single contraction. I rested the rest of the time until I was 10 cm around 2:30pm. So this is where everything got a little crazy.'), ('0.4', 'I didn’t feel myself pushing for the first hour and half, or if I was pushing I don’t think it was done correctly and all it did was make me extremely tired. And then the epidural either stopped working or it ran out or I have no idea because SHIT HIT THE FAN. I could feel every fucking thing. The contractions were horrendous to me and pushing didn’t really offer any relief. The doctor came in and turned her from face up to face down and that hurt crazy bad. I was yelling in between contractions about how she wasn’t moving despite the nurses telling me she was and that they could see her hair.'), ('0.5', 'I just knew they weren’t being super honest with me and later on I did find out that she was completely stuck under my pelvic bone. But the time it was 4, I was screaming for the doctor to come back and the nurses were trying their best to calm me along with my amazing husband, mom, and sister. I was hysterical which looking back just made everything 10 times worse but I can say that when I was in the moment I had no idea what I was saying/doing. Apparently I was screaming for a c-section, that everyone was trying to kill me and why wouldn’t any one help me??? It’s a little embarrassing but whatever… that shit fucking hurt. Dr. came in and goes, “I am thinking forceps delivery, what do you think?” Apparently me yelling, “GET HER OUT!'), ('0.6', 'GET HER OUT!” was enough confirmation. He informed me there would probably be and episiotomy to which I responded, “I DON’T CARE.” So the forceps were started. I am really glad I didn’t actually see the forceps because my husband said they looked really scary. The dr. putting in the forceps was honestly the worse pain I’ve ever felt in my life. I screamed and was moving a lot and the Dr had to stop and tell me that if I didn’t calm down he couldn’t continue. So I was sort of forced into shutting up for a minute.'), ('0.7', 'There was a couple of painful “tug” feelings and the craziest feeling of just PLOP and she was out. Her dad was crying so hard I had his tears running down my face, my mom kept telling me “OMG SHE’S SO BEAUTIGUL. SHE HAS SO MUCH HAIR!” and I was kind of in daze. They had to take her to be measured and everything right away since the whole forceps thing and she was SUPER quiet. Like no crying at all so of course I am yelling if she’s okay which she was. Guys, it was crazy scary and no amount of preparation will prepare you but damn is she worth it.'), ('0.8', 'I would do it again a hundred times if she was always the end result. I am sorry my birth story isn’t beautiful or sentimental but it was what was. And I would do it again. Because being this little girl’s mommy is the best thing that has ever happened to me. And it is true... you do start to forget.'), ('0.9', '')]"
"BIRTH STORY - 34 weeks, hospital stay, NICU stay","[('0.3', 'We got to leave our stuff in my long-term room as that would be my recovery room. Normally you get moved to recovery floors after labor, but I got to keep my room. - Hooked up to belly monitors for entire induction, eventually the nurses found me wireless ones which were a lot better. - Hooked up to IV (had gotten mine removed after antibiotics were done). The veins blew out 3 times in my arms and I had to get a 4th in my hand. All of that was utterly painful. - Blood was drawn. &amp;nbsp;\n\nWednesday/34+1 weeks:\n\n- 1:30AM: not dilated, inserted cervix medicine to soften (Cytotec). They check after 4 hours. - 5:45AM: no change, inserted second medicine.'), ('0.4', 'This is quite common they said. Slept some more and our moms and my sister arrived in the next couple hours. - 10:00AM: cervix was soft, but barely dilated. Allowed to eat breakfast. - 12:45PM: 3rd cytotec. Some period like cramping and uncomfortable. - About 5PM-7PM: Opened enough for Foley bulb. 2 hours of bulb which resulted in dilation to 3-4cm. They were shocked at how fast it worked. It fell out when I stood up after peeing.'), ('0.5', 'I think the tube caught on the toilet seat. Didn’t hurt coming out at all, I had to ask the nurse to see if it did come out because I couldn’t lean over easily with the cramping. - 8:27PM: broke water, dilated to 4-5cm, 80% effaced. - 10:40PM: checked again and still dilated to 4-5cm and I was really discouraged at this point and didn’t think I could keep going. I thought it was going to be another day with little change. They broke my water again (they said it resealed itself. I picture that to mean it moved and got pinched off). Contractions becoming much more frequent and consistent and painful after the second break. According to my support people, things moved much more quickly at this point. Thursday/34+2 weeks:\n\n- 12:00AM: dilated to a 7\n- 1:57AM: still a 7 and I started Nitrous Oxide (laughing gas) to help with the fast and painful contractions.'), ('0.6', '- 4:03AM: dilated to a 9, 100% effaced\n- 4:24AM: checked again and time to push! She was born after 9 minutes of pushing (per doctors). Resulted in a 2nd degree tear. - Baby girl born at 4:36AM, 4lb 15oz, 18.5in \n- Doctors consider labor to have started when Foley bulb fell out (8.92 hours), I say when they inserted first cervix softening suppository (27 hours). &amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a hard time with the contractions, the gas helped me focus on my breathing but they were coming 3 in a row with only a 30 second to 1 minute rest after the 3. I did well with moving around until the last couple of hours and then I just couldn’t get comfortable. I had to sign a waiver for the laughing gas that only I would put it to my face. There was one point that I really wanted the pain meds but they said I would have to be off the gas for 15 minutes before getting those and I just couldn’t go without so I kept going. The last hour or two I had to literally be held up in a sitting position by my husband and mom because that was the most comfortable position but I was just so exhausted from the constant contractions. I was supposed to be taking the gas away from my face between contractions but the last half hour I just sucked in all that glorious gas and would literally fall asleep in the half a minute following the 3 sets of contractions.'), ('0.7', 'It felt like the time from 9 dilation to 10 happened super fast for me and I was begging to get checked again and everyone knew that it was time because the checks were SO uncomfortable for me. In hindsight it might have been extra uncomfortable because I was really constipated and didn’t know it until the days following. I thought it was my tear that was making it hard to sit and change position but I think it was actually the constipation. &amp;nbsp;\n\nBaby was put on my stomach for delayed cord clamping and the first checks of her. But because she was before 36 weeks they had to take her to the NICU. I got to hold her one more time before they left and she had a cpap breathing tube (just over her nose) by then. My husband went with her and stayed there until I came with our moms and sister around 7AM. We went back to my recovery room and slept. I pumped, ate and then we went back to her and within that 4 hours she had already gotten the breathing help removed. She ended up staying 12 days, had a day of phototherapy for jaundice and got a feeding tube in her nose to help her finish her bottles.'), ('0.8', 'She also had an IV for low glucose levels for a few days. Only had temperature regulation for a few days as well. They kept increasing her feeds starting with 5 mL and leaving the hospital with 45 mL. We were lucky and got a private NICU room. After being discharged from the hospital I would go daily for 10-12 hours and my husband would come after work on MWF and came with me the whole date on Tue/Thur and weekends. I pumped every 3 hours and explored breastfeeding but really just exclusively pump. The first few days in the NICU I was getting enough to do 1-2 feeds and the rest formula. Now she’s all breast milk at a month old. We were adding HMF Enfamil supplement to each bottle until her doctor appointment last week where she said to hold off to see how she does on just breastmilk. The NICU said she probably would be on it until her due date and/or 8lbs but the pediatrician thinks otherwise.'), ('0.9', 'Once I go back to work I’ll wean from pumping probably. My goal was 6 weeks of breastmilk before I knew she was coming early, now I might go a bit longer. &amp;nbsp;\n\nShe was born on Groundhogs Day and discharged on Valentine’s Day. Due date was March 14. I still can’t wrap my head around that she wouldn’t have even been due yet. She’s doing fantastic. Was back to her birth weight on discharge day and gained a whole pound by the following week. &amp;nbsp;\n\nBaby Tax:\n\nBefore feeding tube - http://imgur.com/j4baCXi\n\nWith tube - http://imgur.com/V8uJygp\n\nGoing home - http://imgur.com/zyQjvhi\n\nHome - http://imgur.com/ERD6FJQ\n\nToday - http://imgur.com/UATZhKk')]"
"Birth Story: In which this STM writes a novel comparing her childbirth experiences in rural vs urban hospitals. VBAC, positive.","[('0.3', 'Not getting checked all the time made active labour a lot less stressful for me because I didn’t feel like I was being rushed, and I didn’t have this constantly (un)changing number looming informing us all of how incompetent my body was at childbirth. Having permission asked and granted before the checks both on the assessment side and labour and delivery made it feel like I did have some control, and really reinforced the sense that what I wanted would be respected. The nurses we saw in the postpartum unit were also excellent, with the exception of one who freaked out when I didn’t respond as quickly as she thought I should to her demands that I get up to pee and her interrogation about how I was feeling. (She had woken me up from a dead sleep roughly 6 hours after I gave birth. I needed a minute.) She also never brought me the blanket I asked for, and then scolded my husband for giving me one of the ones we brought from home for him when she came back later. On the very positive, when the night nurse came to check on us, our daughter had just had her first bowel movement and it was a meconium everywhere up her back and across her stomach situation. My husband was just getting started with the diaper change when she came in. She paused for a moment, taking it all in. “Would you like me to bathe this child?”\n\nNot only did she bathe her, but she brought her back in the most perfect swaddle I’ve ever seen, which we have been trying to emulate for the past two weeks without success. And she brought me an ice pack that didn’t leak everywhere, Tylenol and Advil, and another pair of the stretchy hospital underwear. She was just lovely. As far as the actual childbirth experience is concerned: it was so incredibly positive for me, and I am so glad we made the decision to go to the city and try for the VBAC. **Part Two:**\n\nI was due on September 21 and woke up having contractions every 10 minutes that morning. They weren’t strong, and they weren’t very long, really just uncomfortable enough to prevent me going back to sleep and regular enough to make me consider the possibility that they weren’t Braxton Hicks. (I had BH all the time during the last month with my first, rarely with my second.) When my husband woke up he insisted we go get checked out. I succeeded in delaying until I had a shower and convinced him to take me to the local hospital first before rallying the troops for childcare etc. I was 1cm, but because of the distance, the previous C-section, and it being a weekend when the local hospital did not have an OB on call, we were told to go to the city. (Sidebar: you know your town is too small when someone you know passes you on the highway 40 minutes out of town, and within half an hour you’ve been texted “Good luck” by most of your mutual friends.)'), ('0.4', 'Once we got to the city, my husband calmed down a lot. I got him to take me out for lunch and we spent the afternoon walking in the river valley and then wandering around downtown before we went to the hospital to get checked again. The contractions never let up, but they also never got more than uncomfortable. We went to the hospital around 5:30, got checked, and then took in the 7pm showing of Downton Abbey and had a late supper in a pub while we found a hotel for the night. We drove home after mass the next day, thankful to have had a test run for parking and navigating the hospital. The next week was uneventful. My MIL returned to her house, my husband painted the halls, I entertained our toddler and continued to make freezer meals for after the birth. On Sept. 27, we made the trip back to the city for an appointment with the OB. I was still 1cm. She did a membrane sweep and ordered a NST at the hospital to confirm there was no reason to induce sooner. There wasn’t, and we were told to call Sunday night to schedule the induction for Monday if I didn’t go in to labour over the weekend. I started having cramps during lunch, but they were even less convincing than the contractions I had on my due date so after touring a few hardware stores comparing prices on materials for my husband’s next putter project, we drove home again. This turned out to be a very good thing. My MIL needed to go to the ER about a kidney stone and infection shortly after we got home. So my husband took her to the local hospital while I made supper and tucked our not quite 2 year old in to bed for the night. The cramps crossed the line from uncomfortable to actually kind of painful while I was doing bedtime, so around 8pm. I was not thrilled at the prospect of getting in the car again and ignored them in favour of taking a bath and reading some more of Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments. I started texting a friend of mine about how she knew when it was real labour, she recommended drinking a bunch of water and waiting an hour. If I was dehydrated, the contractions should ease off, if it was the real deal they’d probably get stronger. They got stronger, so at 10pm I went to bed.'), ('0.5', 'Shortly after 11pm, I still couldn’t sleep so I woke my husband up, he woke his mother up, and we piled in to the car again; stopping for coffee and tea at Tim Hortons before we left town, thankful we were leaving before midnight and it was still an option. We stopped to use the bathroom at a Boston Pizza about half way to the city. They were closing when we got there but hadn’t locked the door yet. Bless the bartender, she took pity on me and let us in. (Alberta is an incredible province, but the pit stops are a far cry from the ONRoutes you see in Ontario. Last time we stopped at a non-privately owned bathroom we made the horrifying discovery that it was a BYO toilet paper and soap. Popping a squat beside a tree actually seemed more hygienic.) We arrived at the hospital around 2:30am. I was having contractions lasting about a minute every 5 to 7 minutes, but I was only 2cm dilated. We stayed in the assessment unit until about 6am. The doctors suggested inducing because I was already a week overdue, but I really didn’t want to. To my anxious mind, induction meant C-section, which I wanted to avoid. So when we said we’d go get a hotel and stay in the city the rest of the weekend and come back if anything changed, they gave me a shot of morphine and gravol and gave us the ok to leave. It’s next to impossible to get a hotel room early in the morning, not even the ones by the airport had a room available. My husband eventually found us one. We checked in around 8am and spent most of the day sleeping. Contractions tapered off again while we were asleep. Around 3pm we got up and dressed and went to an IHOP for breakfast. Then we went to a 5pm mass at a nearby church, during which contractions started up again with more intensity, still lasting about a minute every 5 to 7 minutes. Then we wandered through the mall and went back to the hospital around 8pm planning to ask for another shot of morphine and gravol before crashing at the hotel for the night.'), ('0.6', 'As it turned out, I had dilated another centimetre since the morning, so the resident in the assessment unit didn’t want to send us away right away. I got my painkillers and took the shittiest nap ever - woke up for every contraction and then fell asleep again. Somewhere in there my husband went back to the hotel to collect our stuff, but didn’t check us out for reasons I still don’t understand. The next time I got checked, I think around 3:30am on Sept. 29, I was 4cm. The resident admitted us pending a delivery room being available, offered an epidural and recommended breaking my water. He also did an ultrasound to confirm the baby was in the right position. Possibly not in that order. To my anxious mind, breaking my water was the thing that had set us on the clock with my first child and therefore would result in a C-section if it didn’t happen on its own. The doctor and the nurse both did a really good job of explaining why that was not the case, but didn’t push it and reassured me that there was no reason we couldn’t just let things progress naturally. Also in my anxious mind, the epidural was to be avoided because when my sister had her son her labour had stalled after getting it and then had to be augmented with oxytocin. During my first delivery, our daughter went in to distress immediately after the oxytocin started, therefore epidural equals oxytocin equals C-section. Anxiety isn’t overly concerned with the facts. I was also worried about the combination of drugs in it making me less lucid for the birth and impacting my memory. As with breaking my water, they explained why these things were unlikely and reassured me that I did not have to have the epidural. At 6:30am we made the trek down the hall and through the doors from the assessment unit to labour and delivery. We repeated the conversations about breaking my water and about the epidural with the doctor and the nurse (shift change) and I was either reassured or impatient enough at that point that I said they could break my water if it didn’t happen naturally by 7am. The nurse shot down my request for breakfast citing the VBAC policy and went hunting for the wireless monitor so we could do some walking after being restricted to the bed in the assessment unit all night. At 7:30am they broke my water and we started walking. Something I really liked about the labour and delivery unit was that it was a natural circuit to walk around. You didn’t have to backtrack to get back to where you started, and you could race the other labouring women.'), ('0.7', 'They didn’t know we were racing, which is a shame because by the time we stopped walking the one lady was lapping me. When we started walking, we could do one lap in between contractions. By the time we went back to the room (roughly 9am) we weren’t even making it down one hallway. The other really helpful thing the nurse did while we were walking was at some point when we stopped at the room, she showed my husband how to do a counter pressure thing on my lower back. She was a lot better at it than he was, mainly because she wasn’t afraid of hurting me and understood more pressure is better, but I was still glad to have him doing it. She also tracked down some ice chips for me to munch on in lieu of the solid food and water I wanted but was not allowed. My timeline after we got back to the room is hazy. I know I asked for the laughing gas shortly after we got back, and that I spent a while on the toilet convinced I just needed to take a massive poop and not understanding what the nurse meant by “that’s your baby’s head you’re feeling.” I know that my husband called the hotel to check us out at 10:30am, at which point my contractions were happening on top of each other. I remember asking “why on God’s green earth I wanted to do this without drugs” and swearing a lot. I don’t remember apologizing for the swearing or the yelling, but my husband has been laughing at me about it for the last two weeks because I apologized to him and the nurse so many times and would not accept their assurances that labour pain gave me a pass to be as loud as I wanted. I asked for the epidural, but when the nurse checked me I was 10cm, and as she put it “that ship sailed a while ago.”\n\nIt’s crazy how fast things went from there. The nurse called for the doctor, but four other women were all ready to push at the same time as me so the two doctors on the unit were literally running from room to room for deliveries and didn’t answer the call. I know she told me not to push yet, and then to push slow; my body did neither of those things and didn’t  give me a choice. There wasn’t time to get the stirrups set up or the bottom of the bed broken. She hit the red button at the head of the bed, grabbed one of my legs and told my husband to grab the other. The doctor arrived as my daughter was being born and bullied my husband in to cutting the cord. He did it without fainting, exceeding both our expectations. Adrenaline is one hell of a drug. Girl, 7lbs 7oz of perfection, with a full head of dark brown hair and smoky blue eyes. A very slight tear that got one stitch, and some minor abrasions from how quickly she came out.'), ('0.8', 'We got to do skin to skin almost right away. I didn’t even think to offer her the breast for almost an hour, I was just totally enthralled with her. I didn’t even offer her to my husband to hold until we were being moved down to postpartum. Then I realized he hadn’t held her yet and started apologizing for hogging her. He said he didn’t mind and that she was my baby and I could hold her as much as I wanted and he’d get his snuggles in when I fell asleep. I got the shakes really bad shortly after she was born, I think the nurse said it was the crash from the adrenaline. Hospital food is awful but I was very glad for the lunch the nurse brought me in my postpartum room, and the cake my brother in law brought. I don’t remember why he was in the city, but he had something that finished late the night before. In any case, my husband called him to tell him our daughter had been born while I was still holding her in the delivery room and he showed up at the hospital before we got moved to postpartum. He’s definitely seen my boobs now. Husband asked if I minded if BIL came in and I made some smart ass comment about how I wasn’t getting dressed or fixing my hair, but if BIL was ok with that I was fine with a short visit. In the two weeks since she was born, I’ve been a lot more at peace with my C-section than I was before the VBAC. I’ve been reflecting on it a lot. I think part of it is that having now given birth the “normal” way I don’t feel like it’s something I “failed” to do. The other thing that has really changed is my understanding of how not normal my induction experience was, and that my C-section was definitely medically necessary when it happened. What I keep coming back to is how different the labour pain was. When I was induced, every contraction was a sharp, stabbing pain. This time it was all just pressure. Intense pressure like nothing I’ve ever felt before, but pressure more than pain. It definitely hurt, but it didn’t hurt at all how I expected it to and that made it a lot more manageable.'), ('0.9', '')]"
"Finally, my birth story (off the rails from birth plan, positive hospital/induction story)","[('0.3', ""After a few hours though... they would come in, check to see if I was dilated more and up the pitocin. It got to the point where every time they came in to up the dosage I just wanted to die. We were getting nowhere with dilating but the contractions were HORRENDOUS. Picture Reagan from The Exorcist flailing around in the bed -- that was me. I didn't want an epidural and that was the plan, but at one point Sue asked me if I wanted to reconsider. I asked to talk it over with the husband (who was AMAZING the whole time, helping me breathe through contractions and just doing everything and anything he could to help me. I couldn't have asked for a better dude by my side, for real. He was the only one I had there so I 100% leaned on him.""), ('0.4', 'I know it got very difficult for him to see my like that..) \n\nAnyway, I decided at that point that although the birth plan was to not have an epidural, I also didn\'t plan on having to be induced and get 3 times the amount of pitocin, and basically at that point I wasn\'t toughing it out through the pain --  I seriously felt like I was actually suffering and it wasn\'t necessary. I was going to push a human out of my crotch no matter what -- HUGE KUDOS to those of you who do it without drugs, but it wasn\'t going to happen that way for me. They had to give me another thing of saline so it took an hour for them to do that until I got the epidural, and in that hour I was a madwoman with the contractions. I kept telling them I had to poop and the nurse would say ""no, it\'s the baby! We have to get you this epidural soon!!"" but I kept insisting NO, i had to POOP and would go to the bathroom. At one point I was on the toilet and my husband was standing next to me rubbing my back trying to make me feel better. A particularly horrible contraction hit and for SOME REASON my reaction was to lift up his shirt and blow a giant raspberry on his stomach (where that came from -- who knows!!)'), ('0.5', 'So he started laughing, thinking that I was trying to lighten the mood, but I started screaming at him ""SHUT THE FUCK UP, THIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE!"" Anyway, sweet baby jesus, when that epidural took effect and I couldn\'t feel my bottom half it was all amazing from there on out. All of a sudden at one point everyone started coming in and I asked what was going on -- they said ""It\'s time for the baby to come!"" No, I\'m not ready!!! They said it didn\'t matter if I was ready, the baby was ready and that\'s all that mattered. My beloved nurse Sue and my husband grabbed my legs and she told me when to push. I had NO clue if I was actually pushing because I couldn\'t feel a single thing. Sue told me I was doing great and said ""if you reach down you can feel her head.""'), ('0.6', 'I reached down and felt this hairy thing between my legs, and yeah, it was the top of a hairy head. The next contraction came and I pushed again. She was out a little bit more!! The nurse asked if I wanted them to bring in a mirror so I could watch her be born and i said no, and then she said ""well if you never have another child this is your only chance to see this!"" which struck a chord so I told her to bring it. As soon as I looked in it and saw the chaos that was between my legs I started screaming for them to take it away, haha. Nope, don\'t need to see that! The third push came and I pushed as hard as I could -- then I heard it-- the screaming crying of my daughter.'), ('0.7', 'I started screaming ""IS SHE NORMAL??? IS SHE NORMALLLLLLL??"" since during her sonograms she was always covering her face, haha. She was thrown on my chest, a slippery gross mess covered in goo (I briefly remember thinking ""is this what my insides smell like?"").

The nurse came back after an hour and praise god, I had progressed to a 5-6cm! This was really happening, and we then moved (I walked, very slowly and had to grab the wall with each contraction) to our L&amp;D room. Got there around 11:30 pm and my doula suggested I get in the shower until they could get the portable tub I had rented ready. I stripped down to just a sports bra and sat in the shower, noticed I was losing my mucus plug and continued to have more bloody show, and basically used the detachable shower head to keep spraying the warm water down my back, over my belly, etc. At this point, contractions were prob every few minutes apart and were sooo intense, but I was still able to breathe and moan through them. The nurses knew I wanted to go med-free and were pretty hands-off, only coming in to use the doppler every 30-60 minutes. After over an hour in the shower, I had to get back in the bed (ugh, not fun) and the nurse came back and checked me and said I was at a 7, and then needed to place the heplock in and check baby's heartrate with the doppler (all was good). By then the tub in the room was ready.""), ('0.4', 'Oh man, getting in there felt SO GOOD, but of course I could still feel the very intense contractions. I was [sooo fucking tired](http://imgur.com/0DvMXTz) and could only manage to breathe and moan through each wave. My doula encouraged me to moan *low* so it would help move baby down, and she\'d remind me to relax my face and relax my shoulders with each contraction. The nurse originally said I could stay in the tub for an hour and that they\'d have to come check me again, but after the hour she found baby\'s heartrate with the doppler and she was doing perfect, so they let me stay in another hour and a half without being monitored. I believe I threw up one other time while in the tub (into a plastic container), and basically kept asking for cold washcloths for my forehead and back of my neck, and for cold water, otherwise I just needed someone\'s hand to squeeze during contractions. I tried to keep my mind focused on breathing through each contraction, and it also helped if someone counted to 30 because I knew if I got to 30 seconds, the pain at least couldn\'t get any stronger. I also did some visualizations where I tried to isolate the pain in this oval shape, if that makes any sense, like I tried to imagine the pain happening outside my own body and in its own ""container"" - that probably doesn\'t make any sense. :)  At around 3 a.m. the nurse came back and said she needed to check my cervix, so I got on the bed and was shocked and relieved to hear I was at a 10 cm with a bulging bag of waters,  it was time to push!

First, though, they had to break my water, which felt like a pop, a gush of warm liquid, and PRESSURE. Then, it was go time - pushing. You guys, this part sucked the most. I\'ve read from other birth stories that pushing can feel amazing and productive, but for me, it was just awful. It felt awkward, and I felt so physically weak. We tried several different positions and I kept crying, saying ""I hate this!"" or ""I\'m failing!"" and my doula, husband, and nurses were right there to reassure and coach me.'), ('0.6', 'It had been going on over 2 hours and baby was making no progress coming down the birth canal. and I was zapped of all energy. Finally a new nurse came in and suggested I try pushing on my side, even though I had tried that position earlier and found it sooo much more painful. But I knew I needed to do it to get baby out, since they said she was face up and needed to turn. Here\'s an important turn of events: I was exhausted, and starting to question whether I had the strength (mental AND physical) to push out my baby. It was a really, really low point. Like, to the point where if they had said ""we need to chop off your arm to get this baby out,"" I woulda responded, ""just do it.""

Next, I could feel her crowning (honestly, not the worst pain), I reached down and could feel the top of her head, and in the next few contractions she was out, my girl was born at 6:08 a.m. on 5/16/16. They put her on my chest and I looked up at husband and just said ""oh my god, I love her, she\'s so cute!"" We were both crying and smiling and he was saying how amazing I had done, and I could see the love in his eyes for her.

While they did this, they gave me pitocin to stop my bleeding, and stitch up my first-degree tear.

"Marcus Alistair BIRTH STORY - born 40 + 4 days on June 2 2013. 11 hour labour, natural delivery in Canadian hospital. SO was my rock to the very end &lt;3","[('0.3', 'They say I can go back home to labour more or stay if we wanted. With dilation estimates being about 0.5 – 1cm per hour, they say labour could be another 6-12 hours. I am still 2.5 minutes apart, often with “coupled contractions” where they come in pairs. Although we live 10 minutes away, we choose to stay. They take us to our L&amp;D room. Contractions: Very painful. Lots of whining from me “It huuuurrts...*whimper whimper*...oweeee!” Shocking: I am a very, very emotional person and it doesn’t take much to make me cry; I did not shed a single tear during labour. Also, I craved licorice (my parents brought me Nibs which I devoured after delivery). : I didn’t plan to have a must-have all-natural labour. SO and I agreed ahead of time that we would prefer to go without pain meds, but that we would have open minds depending on how things went.'), ('0.4', 'Well, I say that I can remember asking (yelling?) for pain meds at least a half-dozen times. SO said it was maybe three times. He carefully ignored my requests and distracted me with his mantra : “In through the nose, out through the mouth.” I swear he is the only reason I survived this labour – he is my rock! 11:00am – The nurse and doctor come in to assess where I’m at. I hear the words “9cm” and I say, “OH THANK GOD!” I believe I owe my quick progression from 4cm-9cm to my having the coupled contractions (my uterus working over-time!). Heart rate monitor: Because my maternal heart rate is being mixed up with the fetal heart rate, an internal fetal monitor (the electrode wire spun into Baby’s scalp) is placed in. This, unfortunately, forces me to stay in bed from then on. 12:50pm – I am at 10 cm and the doctor breaks my water. There’s a tugging sensation but no pain.'), ('0.5', 'It’s time to push! Pushing – The nurse provides the mantra: “Push back against the pain”. The nurse holds back my left leg and SO holds back my right leg. The plan: push 3 times during a contraction. It is tempting to push against their holds on my legs, but this is the incorrect technique. Instead, let your legs float back towards your head and  imagine pushing back on the pain through your anus. Seriously, think “bowel movement” (an incredibly painful one) and your body will push the baby out. The pushing technique took practice - just keep trying to do better every contraction. I told the nurse, ""Just keep telling me what to do and I\'ll do it!"" Arm bar: My SO is a strong man, something that I tested this day.'), ('0.6', 'The nurse does a lot of scampering about to arrange things for the doctor, so SO was in charge of holding back both of my legs. He’s on my right side and he reaches across to hold back the left leg. I end up instinctively using his left arm as a pull bar! I reef so hard on his arm for the rest of pushing. Later he admits that it was close to becoming hyper-extended. 2:10pm – Baby is born :) Birth was really cool. As soon as the doctor said she could see the head, it gave me the energy to DO THIS. The doctor says, “Okay stop pushing for a moment. Now give me a couple of light grunt pushes.” From here on, there was NO pain – I knew this meant he was right there. Baby’s head was out, then the body (which felt really cool to pass, by the way) and then there was crying!'), ('0.7', 'Delayed cord clamping: we requested DCC ahead of time. Our doctor was totally on board with this decision as long as the baby came out making noise. When they broke my waters, there was meconium (he pooped inside). If he came out not making noise, it was possible that he had swallowed some of the meconium; thus, needing to have his cord cut right away and then taken to the side to have the black tar-like poop removed from his throat. They called a paediatrician to be on stand-by to do this. Luckily, Marcus came out crying so he was plopped onto my tummy and we had the DCC. Delivering the after birth – the second Marcus came out, the nurse stuck me in the left thigh with oxytocin – this reduces internal haemorrhaging when the placenta detaches, and to promote shrinking of the uterus. (Rubbing or patting your belly can also signal your brain to release oxytocin into your body). The doctor does some slight tugging on the cord; the placenta isn’t quite ready so she waits. In a couple of minutes, the placenta detaches inside and, with some pushing on my end, the placenta (and a whole bunch more fluid) comes out (this was not painful – felt like passing a large, soft and lumpy stool – plop, plop, plop).'), ('0.8', 'Tearing – 2nd degree tearing occurred (skin + connective tissue) while I was pushing. It went in two directions in the vagina so complicated stitching took over an hour. Note: I did not actually feel any moment during pushing where I was like, “And right there I tore.” Pushing came with a “burning ring of fire” feeling when the head was on its way. During this time is when I believe the tearing occurred. Humility – Legs spread. Vagina just hanging out. Puked a few times. Half a dozen people in the room. REALLY, it’s ALL GOOD. It didn’t take long for baby to be cleaned, measured and assessed and back in my arms for the duration of the stitching.'), ('0.9', 'SO and I fell in love with our LO immediately and, of course, that is all that mattered,\n\nTLDR – No-meds 11 hour labour; vaginal delivery.

After some bonding time, I got to take a shower (AMAZING) and get set up with my pads and ice packs (ALSO AMAZING). They washed and weighed the baby and he tipped the scales at 9lb5oz, which got me some major kudos from the nurses, hah! We tried to get him to nurse but he was just too tired.

By the time I got to the car, I was making quite a bit of noise with each contraction, and they were three minutes apart at about one minute each. We took the dogs home and raced back to the birthing center, arrived at about 4:30 pm, and little did I know, I was minutes away from the transition stage. The birthing tub would just not fill quickly enough for me, so I knelt on all fours on some towels while they sprayed my lower back with a shower head while it filled and breathed super hard through my contractions.'), ('0.6', 'The best method I could find was taking deep breaths and doing a motorboat sound with my lips - not only did it make sure I wasn’t tensing my pelvic floor, but the vibration of my lips somehow tickled enough that it distracted from the pain. I found that if I could get through ten of these breaths, it would get me through the peak and I would be done at about breath sixteen or eighteen. Finally, the tub was filled to a good level and I was in full-blown transition. I continued to labor on all fours with legs wide apart, and rocking up and down really hard during contractions. After a few, I looked up and told her that I couldn’t do this, that I wanted her to check me to see if it was too late to go to the hospital and get an epidural. It’s funny to look back on this because it was obviously WAY too late, as little did I know, she could already feel my baby’s head coming down the canal.'), ('0.7', 'She exchanged looks with my husband and said “I’ll make you a deal. You get through five more contractions, and I’ll check you.”  (I found out later she thought this is how many more it would take til the baby was crowning, that it was far too late to do a hospital transfer, and that I would have ended up having the baby med-free in an ambulance instead of a fabulous birthing center). After three, I said “I know we made a deal that I would do five, but can you check me now?”  She said “ok, but to do that you’re going to have to move up on the bed.”  I started sobbing and said I couldn’t get out of the tub... and on the fifth contraction, my water broke and labor REALLY got down to business. I knew then it was too late, and I was going to have to rely on my body to just go... somehow, that calmed me down and I went into labor zombie mode. My husband sat on the side of the tub, and between contractions, I hooked my shoulders over his knees and collapsed there, dangling. Unfortunately (sorry if TMI!)'), ('0.8', 'I had horrific diarrhea from the castor oil and the tub had to be emptied  and re-filled twice during transition. At some point, my midwife told me that I should feel free to push if I wanted, but I could do what felt right. I wanted this OVER, so I tried pushing, but not much happened. She said to go ahead and make some noise, as I was still just doing the motorboat breath thing, so I screamed bloody murder for a contraction. This cracks me up to recall, but she said, “Wow, those are some powerful sounds you are making, but they are going to really hurt your voice and are letting too much air out that could be used for pressure to help your baby out. Will you try some lower grunting noises on this next one?”\n\n\nAfter a few contractions and not much progress, she checked the baby’s heart rate with a Doppler, and it had fallen quite a bit.'), ('0.9', 'With quite a bit of assistance, they helped me out of the tub and onto the bed - she checked the baby, and somewhere during labor, she had turned posterior, which explained why she couldn’t come out in the tub in the position I’d been in. So funnily enough, although I’d planned for a water birth and chosen a birthing center for this very reason, I ended up giving birth on my back in a bed. We had to get my baby past my pubic bone, so I hiked my knees wide apart, my midwife knelt in front of me, and I put my feet on my midwife’s shoulders - her assistant was behind her with her arms stretched and arms crossed in front of them both, grasping my hands. With each contraction, I pulled with my arms and pushed with my feet and pushed as hard as I could with my whole body and ROARED. After about half an hour of pushing, I felt the ring of fire and stopped like all the books told me to - but my midwife said she wouldn’t let me tear and to PUSH!!! I swear I had an out of body experience on the next contraction and felt more powerful than I have ever felt in my entire life - I got her head through, and was only remotely aware of pushing the rest of her body through, not even waiting until the next contraction. I still wasn’t mentally aware I was done and kept asking “is she out, is she out?”, and then all of a sudden she was on my chest and the floods of tears broke for both my husband and I.\n\n\nZoey is a champion nurser and latched on about thirty seconds after they put her on my chest and hasn’t let up since.

The c-section itself was difficult because of my blood pressure. The epidural they gave me didn't work perfectly because my levels were so elevated, so I had to deal with a decent amount of pain and feeling while they operated. They said they couldn't give me any other pain meds until after the baby was born because it was risky to her, which I was more than happy to deal with. Finally, at 3:53 on June 1, Cora Lynn was born. She was 32 weeks, 2 days, and weighed 3lbs 3oz at birth.

I was told I wouldn't be able to see her again until the Thursday afternoon, once I was off the magnesium they were giving me to prevent seizures due to my elevated blood pressure.

I do remember the doctor telling me that she had never given so much medicine to someone and not had them respond to any of it. Once I was settled in for the night, I sent my husband to NICU to go see our beautiful daughter. She needed someone there, and since I couldn't be I wanted him by her side.

Friday morning I had some more blood work taken, and while i eas waiting for those labs to come back I made a break for the NICU by wheelchair. I finally got to see my little girl!
