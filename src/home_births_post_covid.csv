The midwife got to us around noon, not long after I got in the pool. I was extremely annoyed everytime the midwife was touching me. The second midwife got there about 15 minutes later.'), ('0.4', ""Around 12:30 my uterus started to push. I can't say that I felt the urge to push, my body just sort of took over and did his own thing, the midwife had a look but I didn't wanted to be touched so she took a step back and let me do my own thing which I'm really grateful for. I went into my own world from that point, I pictured my body pushing like being stuck in a ripe current and I tried to let myself float and not fight it. The midwife told me she thought I fell asleep for a second.""), ('0.5', ""When I reached the ring of fire It was a lot harder to not fight it and I apparently said that I didn't like that feeling. It was really painful, it's the only part I remember feeling any pain during labour. My midwife instructed me to push slowly and I thought to myself that I'm not pushing anyway, my body is. It was a really out of body kind of experience because I don't have the feeling I ever did anything just let things happen how my body wanted to.""), ('0.6', ""Then in one big push I felt the head come out, I touched it and it was the weirdest thing I ever experienced, it'sthe moment the reality of it all hit me. I was having a baby. I didn't enjoy pregnancy at all, the movements, the feeling of having a parasite inside of me but it never felt completely real until that second I touched her head, she wasn't a parasite anymore but my little girl, my little miracle that I made from scratch. At the next push she was completely out and I grabbed her and put her [on my chest](http://imgur.com/a/qEiZKaT)\n\nThe midwife cut the cord once it stop pumping, I got out of the the pool and we did skin to skin for about an hour, I don't remember delivering the placenta it just sort off slide out of me sometimes in that first hour.""), ('0.7', ""It felt gross, it looked gross as well.

"Graduated! Third time mom 38+5, difficult but positive planned home birth","[('0.3', 'I moved around a lot - on and off the bed, in and out of the shower. Nothing brought me any relief. The midwife checked me at one point and I was 7 cm and I found that incredibly disheartening. I didn’t know how I would be able to finish when I already felt so discouraged. I felt like I was being a huge baby! But of course everyone was lovely and supportive.'), ('0.4', 'I was also agonizing over whether or not we should break my water. With my second breaking my water instantly catapulted me into transition and it was so scary and intense, but he was born 38 minutes after so it was at least fast. I couldn’t decide if I was willing to face that intensity again but knowing that there was a good chance it would speed things along. After going back and forth for a while I decided to do it. My reasoning was that I was already in agony so maybe it would be worth it to speed things along? So the midwife broke my water but it didn’t end up changing anything intensity wise.'), ('0.5', 'It did feel good psychologically, however, to feel like I had “done something”. So we laboured along and at some point she checked me again and I was still at 7 cm! She offered to “help” me though and to manually stretch my cervix over my baby’s head so I could then start pushing. I accepted this offer and it was supremely painful, she had her fingers inside me and with a contraction I had to push while she pushed my cervix aside. If you had asked me before labour if I would do an intervention like that I definitely would have said “no”, but in the moment I was desperate to get the baby out. Now it time to push.'), ('0.6', 'With my second I didn’t have to push at all. I had the fetal ejection reflex and my body did all the work - 4 involuntary pushes and 8 minutes later my second son came flying out, even with a nuchal hand. This time around was very different. I had to push for about an hour and every single push was a hard fought battle. It felt like my tailbone was going to snap with every push and at points I physically couldn’t even do it because it was so painful. Finally I was able to “push past the pain” and my third son was born at 9:38 am.'), ('0.7', 'Thankfully the relief is instant once they are born! He was born in pretty much the same spot as my second son. I held my baby and rested for a couple minutes and then it was time to birth the placenta. With my first two it just kind of came out and I barely noticed. This time I had a real contraction and had to consciously birth the placenta. It was painful but quick.'), ('0.8', 'I did end up hemorrhaging (lost about 1000 mL of blood) so the midwives gave me a pitocin and an ergot shot. Then we got to snuggle in bed and marvel at how cute our precious baby son was - THAT is why I birth at home. We couldn’t believe how tiny he was but it turns out he’s perfectly average sized: 7 lb 3 oz and 21” long. He is 3 days old now but still hasn’t latched - hoping that will fall into place soon. So overall even though it was difficult, it was a good experience. I love being able to just snuggle up in my own bed after birth.'), ('0.9', 'It also wasn’t actually that long - only about 3 hours of intensity but it felt MUCH longer than that to me. I am a little sad that we didn’t get a girl as this was my last chance but I am so thrilled to have a third precious son.')]"

Got the epidural placed and it was the best decision of my life! Placement sucked (you have to stay still in this awkward position while contacting), but then felt so much better and was able to relax. They checked my cervix at this point and was 4 cm - I was pretty bummed I wasn't further along but the resident said I was fully effaced so it could go quickly.""), ('0.4', ""It was 4am at this point so nurse recommended we get some sleep. My husband went and got our suitcases while they placed my catheter and gave me some pitocin to even out contractions. Husband went to put on PJs when baby's heart rate was dropping on the monitors and the nurse called the full team in. They had me switch positions to see if the cord was just getting compressed but  HR was still low.""), ('0.5', ""They rechecked my cervix to see if that was the culprit and sure enough - I had gone from 4 to 10 cm in \\~30 min and that combined with the emptying of my bladder caused the baby to drop pretty suddenly and startle him. His HR came back up and doctor said I was ready to start pushing! He had us try a practice push with the nurse while he finished something up and baby's HR dropped again during the practice, triggering the alarm again and the full team flooding in. Doctor said at this point they needed to get baby out and they would need to use forceps given how far along he already was.""), ('0.6', 'I had a pretty chill birth plan but REALLY wanted to avoid forceps so we started pushing and he was out in 8 min - about 4 contractions. I had heard pushing with the epidural was difficult for FTM but I was able to feel the contractions coming and pushed really hard into my bottom and it seemed to work! Baby Milo was born at 5:21am and was 6lbs 1oz the day after my birthday and &lt;8 hours after my water broke. The nurses were shocked by the speed of everything and warned me next time to get to the hospital ASAP.'), ('0.7', ""It turns out the cord was wrapped around his neck and was a very thin cord which they think was easily compressed and caused the distress while pushing. After birth was a bit of a blur - I know my husband cut the cord and they took Milo's measurements and we spent the golden hour doing skin to skin. It seemed like my placenta was giving them some difficulty because the doctor has to go in with his hands, so thank god for the epidural. I had a first degree tear and got stitched up too.""), ('0.8', ""It was all very surreal afterwards, I was so happy but also in shock everything happened so quickly. Recovery for me has been uneventful. I really felt pretty good afterwards and was up able to walk around within an hour or two. Day 2 and 3 were a lot more sore and my stiches have been painful (I'm crazy impressed by people with 2nd degree+ tears!!)""), ('0.9', 'but it\'s getting better each day and I\'ve barely been bleeding. Milo has had a slightly tougher ride - he was jaundiced at the hospital and hasn\'t been gaining weight as much as our Ped would like so I\'ve had to do a lot of pumping and supplementation of his milk. I\'m squarely in the ""fed is best"" camp, but it\'s still stressful and A LOT of work to do the triple feedings.

I also had to break up with the homebirth midwife. Which felt like breaking up with a friend. I mostly just felt defeated. This pandemic has been so stressful. I’ve had to make so many hard choices about work and childcare while remaining calm and adult and watching idiots lick each other. Honestly, everyone has been so kind. Homebirth midwife knows many of the hospital midwives, was super supportive and I think a little relieved that she can just isolate and take care of herself. Everyone at the hospital was supportive and straight up said they understood. Also, the more accurate covid test came back negative. MASKS WORK, PEOPLE. *Back to the Hospital and labor*\n\nHospital midwife listened to our situation (we need to schedule something for childcare) and completely understood. She checked labor and delivery and they could induce me next Friday ooooorrrr tomorrow, 5:30am. We picked tomorrow because our babysitter has the weekend off. And that was that.

Babysitter spent the night with us that night, we walked into the hospital at 5:30 AM. Both got the covid quick test, both were negative. Pitocin was hooked up around 6:30, started low. Water broken around 7:30. Contractions were pretty chill. Did you know Comedy Central has about 6 hours of the Office on in the morning? I sat on the edge of the bed and laughed my way through an hour. They cranked pitocin up occasionally, but I never went over 10. Contractions started getting harder to sit through.

I took my stress out on my husbands chest with my head. I felt like this stage wasn’t that long, but also forever? I got mad at the office and turned it off. Contractions were about 2 mins apart, and I moaned through them. I got super nauseous at this point, but only during contractions. I should have taken that as a sign. It was about this point that I decided I might want an epidural, but kept telling myself “just wait after the next one”. I never felt “pressure”, but I could feel something change in my pelvis. When asked, I felt like I had diarrhea and was about to shit myself. It wasn’t “I have to poop” it was “I need to find a toilet because poop is coming”. This is when things changed.

I know I started whimpering “I can’t do this and it hurts too much”. The nurse said “She’s coming on the next push, take a deep breath and let’s do this”. I could feel the next contraction coming, warned everyone, and took a deep breath and just kept pushing. Suddenly the midwife was shouting “Look at me” and I said “Noooo” and my husband said “No, really, LOOK”. I looked down and there was a baby. She was super cheesy.

She came out so fast her head is perfectly round. She’s healthy. I was up and walking around apparently too fast (I scared the nurse). I am grateful I didn’t have pain relief and got to feel all the stuff, but that epidural sure was nice last time. After all of the stress Covid has caused, it is actually a huge relief to have the birth over. My only advice for moms right now is to do what you feel safe doing. When homebirth no longer felt safe, I sucked it up transferred back to the hospital. I’m glad I did, because I know we are healthy and can go home and isolate again. I mean, also if you can get yourself one of those 4 hour labors, I highly recommend. Being pregnant during a pandemic sucks.'), ('0.9', 'I am so grateful it is over.')]"

Around 1 I laid down again and napped between contractions for a while.'), ('0.4', 'My midwives rested some too, and so did my husband. The midwives debated leaving, but between the still-strong contractions, the bloody show, and the water breaking earlier, they knew that labor could step up quickly at any time and they decided to stay. Around 3 my MIL said she wasn’t feeling well - she’d gotten her second Covid shot the day before and got the typical low fever and body aches. My sister in law took off early from work to come watch the kids for us. And this is where things started to turn. We sent the big ones to Grammie’s house to be with their aunt, and then my mom brain shut off and my birthing brain took over. I didn’t realize that having the kids around was detrimental to my progress, but as soon as they left and I could focus on my work, the contractions got a lot more intense. I was so tired. This was around 5 pm. My midwives were giving me lots of encouragement but my contractions were all in my back at this point and I HAAAATE back labor with all my heart. At maybe 5:30 I put my head down on the counter in the kitchen where I was laboring and just cried and cried.'), ('0.5', 'I couldn’t tell you why I was crying but I was ugly crying. Once I released that, I went back to bed. My main midwife asked if I was afraid of something. I said yes: twice now we’ve gotten to the point where I feel like pushing but my cervix wasn’t ready. I don’t think I have the strength to do that again. This baby has to come now. We did a cervix check. I was close to complete and there was a bag of waters still intact in there. So only part of the bag had broken earlier. We did one contraction with my midwife pushing the cervix back to try to get that last bit to melt away. I’ve heard women talk about this.'), ('0.6', ""It is NOT A FUN EXPERIENCE. Then we started discussing whether we should break the waters. I was for it, but I was also scared of labor ramping up even more intensely than it was already. My husband wasn’t a huge fan - what if the cord prolapsed? What if there's a reason the water is still intact? And on the next contraction, the waters broke on their own. This is when shit got REALLY REAL. I couldn’t take the contractions lying on my back anymore and I scrambled to all fours so my husband could give counter pressure. I can’t remember what I said - I think what came out of my mouth was “I gotta get up.” What I meant was “I can’t be on my back anymore.” My husband and my midwives were like HOLD ON YOU CAN’T LEAVE! I was so confused; I wasn’t leaving! And then my body took over and was like PUSHING TIME NOW.""), ('0.7', 'I screamed and yelled and my midwife put on what she calls her Midwife Voice to inform me that I was being a dingbat and should remember to breathe. It came out as a powerful ""BREATHE!!!!"" I took a huge gasp of air and bore down with all the remaining power in me. I grabbed the assistant midwife’s hand and squeezed her fingers until, I’m sure, they hurt. She didn’t say a word. She squeezed right back and gave amazing encouragement while my main midwife talked me through what the baby was doing. I was also yelling at my husband to PUSH ON MY BACK HARDER. And then as I was pushing, my pretty hemorrhoids started to prolapse so my midwife, while providing support to my perineum, also pushed back against my butthole. I kind of lost it. I yelled PLEASE STOP TOUCHING MY BUTT and she didn’t, she kept doing her job and did it so well. Baby was barreling down.'), ('0.8', 'My midwife was saying “head is in view. 3 centimeters out, 4 centimeters.” I loved that verbal progress meter. She was still providing counter pressure so the baby, who was attempting to crown with BOTH HANDS by their face, wouldn’t tear me (and I had needed stitches in every birth to this point). She actually pushed baby’s hands back in and baby’s head was born. The pressure was still tremendous, and though I wasn’t having a contraction, I still kept pushing to get baby’s shoulders born. Husband was encouraging me to keep pushing but suddenly this from my midwife cut through my lizard birthing brain: ""Stop! I have to get the cord off! It’s around the neck!” It took all I had but I stopped. She unwound the cord. Next contraction - which was maybe 30 seconds later - I pushed the rest of my baby out and then I think I laid my head on the bed and sobbed. Baby was wailing beautifully.'), ('0.9', ""I asked my husband “Who do we have? ?” He looked - or tried to; baby had a very long cord and it was all in the way. Then he finally saw. “It’s a girl!”\n\nIt was 6:22 pm. It had been 7 minutes since my water broke. Postpartum recovery has actually been the easiest one so far. Thanks to my midwife's intense perineal support, I didn't need stitches for the first time EVER! Baby has a slight tongue tie so nursing is a little painful, but she seems to be getting what she needs and a nipple shield is helping me keep my nipples intact. Also my midwife is amazing; she came over for a postpartum visit on Saturday and made sure to talk through the labor and birth with me and my husband. I am so glad we had her by our side."")]"

"Very positive birth story! (natural home birth, hypnobirthing)","[('0.3', 'I labored for 3-4 more HOURS and was totally gutted when she showed up again and I was only 4 cm dialated. I’d been vomiting a lot and having a hard time staying hydrated, and this is where my mental game started to break down and I became very reliant on my doula and husband for encouragement. I started to believe I was going to have to labor for another 24 hours or so at that rate, and wasn’t expecting the intensity with which I would long for an epidural and to be taken to the hospital between 1am and 4 am on the morning she was born. I believed for some reason that labor was a steady and linear progression, and at one point I would collapse into my husband and say “I can’t do this” at every surge. Eventually, the hypnobirthing training kicked back in and I had a moment of clarity where I realized that if I didn’t BELIEVE I could do it, I certainly would not be able to.'), ('0.4', 'I realized I needed to affirm for myself that I could do it EVEN IF I wasn’t able to believe it fully in the moments of pain. I asked my husband to MAKE me change the narrative and say “I can do this” on each surge. Whenever one would come I’d say out loud “I can do this.” And he would repeat “you can do this,” and the doula would say “you ARE doing this.” Eventually, I started to believe it with these positive affirmations. My doula realized that a lot of my discouragement was stemming from the belief that I wasn’t progressing, so she called the midwife back to measure me again, and I was delighted to be told I was finally at 7 cm. This marked a turning point for me, and I entered the last part of labor with a new resolve and calmness and clarity— I kept telling myself “this baby is going to be born at home, exactly the way I’ve wanted it.” In hindsight, going from 4-7 cm was very difficult for me.'), ('0.5', 'From 7-10 progressed much faster, at about 1 cm per hour. I didn’t realize that labor could go quicker at the end, and that the final stretch would feel better than the transition period (for me at least). My advice for other moms is to keep your affirmations positive when the going gets tough, and to realize that it’s exactly when you feel like you can’t go on that you are rounding the corner on the most difficult part and approaching the finish line. At the end, crawling into the birthing tub to deliver was a big relief. The baby spent my entire labor sunny side up and only flipped at the end, so I was having intense back labor.'), ('0.6', 'It helped when my husband pushed on my lower back and my doula put her thumb on my “third eye” between my eyebrows and pushed and told me to focus only on that pressure point. That redirection of my focus helped immensely, along with her guiding me through a lotus flower opening visualization. I had two mental blocks in my head that needed to be fixed for me to finally give birth: one was that I had drilled it into my head that I shouldn’t be on my back. What I didn’t realize was that being on my back IN THE WATER would be comfortable for me, much more so than on a bed or hard surface where the sacrum didn’t have room to open up. The second was that it was “wrong” to push.'), ('0.7', 'I felt a strong desire to push towards the end (along with a feeling that I needed to go #2) but was held up because I wanted to “breathe down” the baby. Eventually the doula convinced me to try pushing and taught me how to push more effectively during surges by explaining to me that if I was pushing I couldn’t physically breathe at the same time, so I needed to take a deep breath in, push on the exhale for 10 seconds then STOP pushing while I breathed in again. This was very helpful to learn and pushing felt right for me towards the end. As I rounded the corner on the finish line, I could reach down and feel my water sac and, directly below it, her head. I felt strongly that baby was coming soon and that the sac was in the way, and asked my midwife if I could break my waters.'), ('0.8', 'I reached down and did it myself, which felt pretty metal/baller.

I remember thinking during the few minutes in the shower that I had made a horrible mistake and I wanted the epidural. It turns out that the pain I was feeling actually meant it was time to push!

The castor oil had only kicked in a little bit at that point, but by the time I got home from my appointments, I stared cramping. I worked for another hour to wrap up the last of my duties before taking leave, and by the time I was done I knew I was in labor.'), ('0.5', 'Castor oil is no joke, especially for someone with horrible hemorrhoids, so if you decide to go this route, just know that it is awful — though like with anything, YMMV. I almost think the cramps the oil brought on were way worse than early labor contractions. I labored with my husband until about 10:30 when the first midwife came because I was having 1 minute contractions about 2 mins apart. She helped my husband fill the birth pool so it was ready, and I bounced on my ball and walked around. By this time the castor oil had made its way through my system, so I could tell the difference in my contractions and they were definitely uterine instead of intestinal.'), ('0.6', 'I got in the pool when things started intensifying, though I couldn’t tell you if that was transition or not. The pool was magical! It definitely helped with the pain until I got to pushing around 2:30 a.m. \n\nBy that time the second midwife and their doula/midwife in training arrived, which was a nice addition. I pushed for 3.5 hours in the pool, on the toilet and in my living room, but my bag of waters refused to break! It wasn’t until the last 20 minutes of pushing that we decided to break my bag, and right before we did, my midwife had me do one more push and feel the bulging bag.'), ('0.7', 'That’s when it broke all over the tarped floor. My fluid was completely clear with no meconium even though he was way overdue and I’d taken castor oil. Things got real very fast at that point, and before I knew it, my baby was crowning. Omg, it was the worst pain ever, but feeling his head gave me so much hope that it was about to be over. I just kept telling myself that I was almost done while my husband encouraged me on (he was an amazing birth partner btw, cheering me on and holding my hand the whole way).'), ('0.8', 'I took a few contractions to get through the ring of fire because I didn’t want to tear, putting pressure on my perineum and above my vagina. On my final push, he came out in the water all at once, and I grabbed him and pulled him up to my chest. It was amazing!! All the pain I’d been feeling was gone and he was alert with eyes open almost immediately. He pinked up quickly and we moved to the bed to birth the placenta.'), ('0.9', 'Once it was out, he spent about an hour attached to it to get as much blood as possible while we did skin to skin. I got to shower while my husband did skin to skin and then he cut the cord and baby got his checkup. The midwives left about an hour later and we’ve been in bed since, enjoying our time as a new family. He’s breastfeeding like a champion and we’ve already had our first meconium diaper change. I can’t recommend home birth enough if it’s something that interests you. Being home the whole time was amazing and, frankly, I can’t imagine being in a hospital to give birth unless it was medically necessary. Of course, we had a backup plan to transfer to a hospital if we had to, and I almost gave up and told them to take me in, but I’m so glad I never vocalized that. I got the birth I wanted for me and my baby, and couldn’t be happier.')]"
