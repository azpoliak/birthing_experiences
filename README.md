### Structure of repo

- `data/` - all data goes here. Our original Reddit data is saved in the `original-reddit/` folder.
- `results/` - all results and figures go here. We have 4 results folders: `Corpus_Stats_Plots/`, `LIWC_Results/`, `Personas_Results/`, and `Topic_Modeling_Results/`. Information about these folders are contained in their readmes. 
- `src/` - all coding files go here. Instructions to run the files to replicate results are contained in the appropriate readmes. Our methods included counting persona frequencies, conducting sentiment analysis, running LIWC on our corpus, and running statistical analyses such as t-tests and z-tests. We also computed 95% confidence intervals for some of our data.
