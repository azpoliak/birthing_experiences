Each plot is the average number of mentions of that persona (y-axis) across the average story narrative (x-axis) before COVID compared to the four eras of COVID:
  - March 11, 2020-June 1, 2020 (first wave)
  - June 1, 2020-November 1, 2020 (dip in cases)
  - November 1, 2020-April 1, 2021 (second wave)
  - April 1, 2021-June 24, 2021 (widespread vaccine availability in US, dip in cases)

Pre-COVID values have been normalized to account for longer overall story lengths in the pre-COVID dataset.
